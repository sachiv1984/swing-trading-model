# Product Backlog — Momentum Trading Assistant

**Owner:** Product Owner
**Status:** Active
**Class:** Planning Document (Class 4)
**Last Updated:** 2026-06-22 (session — 1 new item added: BLG-FE-77)
**Last rebalance:** 2026-06-19 (cycle 2026-06-19__scheduled — DL-048–051; 7 promoted-backlog, 1 rejected, 8 parked C1; v6.0 Now section added to roadmap; Product Value Alert + Skill-Silo Alert recorded)

> ⚠️ Standing Notice
> This backlog records prioritisation and intent only.
> All formulas, schemas, API contracts, and behavioural rules are indicative until
> confirmed in the relevant canonical specifications.
> No item may proceed to implementation without canonical owner sign-off.

> 📋 Placement Rule
> New items must be appended to the correct existing type section (§1–§8). Do not create new numbered session sections. The backlog is organised by type, not by session date.
> **Ephemeral sections** (Release Slice tables, Test Scenario Gap sections, and "Returned to Backlog" sections appended by governance engines) are temporary. They must be removed during the next `groom backlog` run after the cycle closes. Any still-open items within them must be promoted to the appropriate §1–§8 type section before the ephemeral section is removed.

*Completed and killed items are recorded in `claude/backlog/backlog_archive.md`.*

### BLG-FEAT-25 — PT-04 Setup Quality Score (backend + frontend)
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Product Feature / Analytics
**Owner:** Head of Backend Engineering; Metrics & Analytics Owner; Head of UX & Design
**Source:** Arc 2 roadmap — deferred from v3.8 (ST-04/ST-05, EPIC-02) — gate not met 2026-05-19: < 20 closed trades. Traceability entry added by delivery verification engine 2026-05-20.
**Effort:** L (~2–4 days, backend + frontend)
**Provisional-Target:** v4.0+ (gate-conditional — explicit re-park confirmed by PO 2026-05-22: advance when 20+ closed trades confirmed)
**Gate:** PO confirms 20+ closed trades in production before sprint planning for the target release. PMO Lead checks gate status at each release planning kickoff.

*PO disposition 2026-05-22: remain on backlog under gate — advance when 20+ closed trades confirmed. STALE flag cleared.*
*ST-10 (backend) and ST-11 (frontend) returned from 2026-05-22__release-v4.0 at sprint planning — gate not met (PO confirmed <20 closed trades 2026-05-23). 4th deferral noted.*
*v4.6 gate audit 2026-05-31 (ST-16 BLG-GOV-33): 6 closed trades total (trade_history WHERE pnl IS NOT NULL); 0 with linked trade_plans. Gate NOT MET. EPIC-02 deferred. 6th deferral (SI-02 Frontend also deferred). Advance when ≥20 closed trades with linked trade_plans confirmed.*
*v5.3 gate re-verification 2026-06-09 (OA-RP-01 / BLG-GOV-106): 6 closed trades (trade_history WHERE pnl IS NOT NULL); 11 total trades. Gate NOT MET. PT-04 remains parked. Next re-verification at v5.4 sprint planning.*
*v5.6 gate re-verification 2026-06-16 (ST-08 / BLG-GOV-106): **13 closed trades** (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trade_history WHERE pnl IS NOT NULL — PO-provided data, 2026-06-16). Gate NOT MET (need 20; 7 more required). Trajectory: accelerating — 7 new closed trades in 7 days (vs prior ~0.5/month estimate). PT-04 remains parked. Next re-verification: when PO confirms 20+ closed trades.*

**Problem**
A deterministic setup quality score (0–100) based on own trade history cannot be computed until sufficient closed trades exist. When the user has entered with similar regime/signal/ATR conditions before, the score reflects historical win rate under those conditions. The gate condition (20+ closed trades) was not met at v3.8 sprint planning (PO confirmed 2026-05-19).

**Scope (Backend — ST-04)**
- `GET /trade-plans/setup-quality-score?ticker={ticker}` endpoint
- Score (0–100) computed from closed trade history matching current regime/signal/ATR conditions
- Gate response: `{"gate_not_met": true, "min_trades_required": 20}` when fewer than 20 closed trades
- Score factors: matching_trades count, win_rate, average_R, score_explanation
- Endpoint registered in backend/routers/test.py and openapi.yaml

**Scope (Frontend — ST-05)**
- Setup Quality Score displayed in Pre-Trade Research View and Trade Plan form
- Score badge with numeric value (0–100) and qualitative label (Excellent/Good/Fair/Low)
- "Insufficient trade history (< 20 trades)" message when gate not met
- Tooltip/expandable: matching_trades, win_rate, average_R

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Backend: endpoint implemented, gate enforced, unit tests cover gate_not_met, gate_met mixed, perfect history
- Frontend: score renders in Pre-Trade Research View and Trade Plan form; gate-not-met state clearly displayed; score updates when ticker changes
- Playwright: score renders; gate-not-met message renders; score updates on ticker change

### BLG-FEAT-26 — ATR position-sizing retrospective analysis
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Product Feature / Analytics
**Owner:** Metrics & Analytics Owner
**Source:** IDEA-metrics-analytics-20260421-01 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** M (~2–3 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** PT-04 (Setup Quality Score) shipped and live for ≥ 30 days; sufficient attributed closed trades to support retrospective.

**Problem**
There is no retrospective view of whether ATR-based position sizing (risked R per trade) was consistent over time, or whether deviation from the ATR sizing formula correlated with outcome. Understanding sizing discipline and its P&L impact requires a dedicated analytics view built on historical trade data.

**Scope**
- Retrospective dashboard: actual position size vs ATR-recommended size per trade
- Correlation view: sizing deviation vs R-multiple outcome
- Summary metric: sizing discipline score over rolling window

**Acceptance Criteria**
- ATR-sizing deviation visible per trade and in aggregate
- Correlation between sizing deviation and R-multiple summarised
- Gate condition verified by Product Owner before sprint planning

---

### BLG-FEAT-27 — Candidate quality retrospective (screener-to-trade attribution)
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Product Feature / Analytics
**Owner:** Metrics & Analytics Owner
**Source:** IDEA-metrics-analytics-20260421-02 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** M (~2–3 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** Screener live ≥ 60 days AND ≥ 60 closed trades with screener attribution.

**Problem**
No retrospective analysis links screener-surfaced candidates to eventual trade outcomes. Without attribution, it is impossible to evaluate whether the screener is generating genuinely high-quality candidates or just high-volume noise. This item requires sufficient attributed history (60d + 60 trades) to yield statistically meaningful results.

**Scope**
- Attribution link: screener candidate → watchlist → trade plan → closed trade
- Retrospective metric: screener hit rate, win rate of attributed trades vs baseline
- Filter by screener run date range

**Acceptance Criteria**
- End-to-end attribution pipeline queryable
- Screener hit rate and attributed-trade win rate reportable
- Gate condition verified by Product Owner before sprint planning

---

### BLG-FEAT-28 — Screener hit rate metric
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Product Feature / Analytics
**Owner:** Metrics & Analytics Owner
**Source:** IDEA-metrics-analytics-20260421-03 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** Screener live ≥ 60 days.

**Problem**
No aggregate metric tracks how often screener results lead to a trade plan or closed position. The screener hit rate (surfaced candidates that progressed to trade) is a key indicator of screener quality and operator workflow efficiency. This metric requires 60 days of screener history to be meaningful.

**Scope**
- Aggregate metric: screener_candidates_total, advanced_to_watchlist, advanced_to_trade_plan, advanced_to_closed_trade
- Displayable in governance/operations reporting view

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Hit rate metric computed and displayable
- Gate condition verified by Product Owner before sprint planning

---

### BLG-FEAT-29 — Regime distribution metric over screener history
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Product Feature / Analytics
**Owner:** Metrics & Analytics Owner
**Source:** IDEA-metrics-analytics-20260421-04 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** Screener live ≥ 60 days.

**Problem**
No view exists showing how market regime distribution (bull/bear/neutral/volatile) has evolved across screener runs over time. Understanding regime frequency and drift helps contextualise screener output quality and strategy performance in different market conditions.

**Scope**
- Aggregate view: regime distribution over screener history (rolling 30d/60d/all)
- Displayable as percentage breakdown or time-series chart

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Regime distribution over screener history computable and displayable
- Gate condition verified by Product Owner before sprint planning

---

### BLG-FEAT-30 — Screener-to-trade full attribution pipeline
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Product Feature / Analytics
**Owner:** Metrics & Analytics Owner
**Source:** IDEA-metrics-analytics-20260421-05 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** L (~3–4 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** Screener live ≥ 60 days AND ≥ 60 closed trades with screener attribution.

**Problem**
The full pipeline from screener hit → watchlist add → research → trade plan → execution → close is not yet instrumented end-to-end. Attribution gaps prevent retrospective analysis of conversion rates at each stage and make it impossible to identify where candidates are lost or degraded.

**Scope**
- Full attribution model: screener_run_id linkage through to trade close
- Conversion funnel: screener → watchlist → plan → closed
- Exportable for offline analysis

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Full attribution pipeline implemented
- Conversion funnel metrics computable
- Gate condition verified by Product Owner before sprint planning

---

### BLG-FEAT-31 — Research-to-trade conversion rate metric
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Product Feature / Analytics
**Owner:** Metrics & Analytics Owner
**Source:** IDEA-metrics-analytics-20260421-06 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** PT-02 (Research View) live ≥ 30 days AND ≥ 30 research sessions with attribution.

**Problem**
No metric tracks how often a research session (opening the research view for a ticker) results in a trade plan creation. This conversion rate is an indicator of research quality and operator decision confidence. Requires 30 days of research session history with attribution.

**Scope**
- Metric: research_sessions_total, sessions_leading_to_plan, sessions_leading_to_closed_trade
- Attribution requires `session_id` or equivalent linkage from research view to trade plan

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Research-to-trade conversion rate computable
- Gate condition verified by Product Owner before sprint planning

---

### BLG-FEAT-32 — Trade plan completion rate tracking
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Product Feature / Analytics
**Owner:** Metrics & Analytics Owner
**Source:** IDEA-metrics-analytics-20260421-07 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** PT-04 (Setup Quality Score) shipped.

**Problem**
No metric tracks what proportion of created trade plans are completed (i.e., result in a closed trade) vs abandoned. The completion rate is a key indicator of plan quality, operator follow-through, and whether PT-04 quality scores correlate with plan execution. Requires PT-04 to create the quality score baseline for correlation.

**Scope**
- Metric: plans_created, plans_completed (closed trade), plans_abandoned, completion_rate
- Optional: completion rate segmented by setup quality score tier

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Trade plan completion rate computable and displayable
- Gate condition verified by Product Owner before sprint planning

---

### BLG-FEAT-33 — Trade plan approval workflow
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Product Feature / Workflow
**Owner:** Product Owner; Head of UX & Design
**Source:** IDEA-trade-plan-20260508-01 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** L (~3–4 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** PT-05 (Trade Plan feature set) live ≥ 3 months with ≥ 20 plans created; operator confirms approval workflow adds value.

**Problem**
Trade plans are currently created and immediately actionable without a formal review or approval step. As plan complexity grows (multi-day setup, multi-leg risk), an explicit approval checkpoint may improve discipline — but the value of an approval workflow vs friction cost is not yet established. Gate ensures sufficient usage history before committing implementation effort.

**Scope**
- Approval state: Draft → Pending Approval → Approved / Rejected
- Approval action: operator-controlled (self-approval supported for solo use)
- Approved plans visible separately from drafts

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Approval workflow implemented and functional
- Plan state transitions correct and persisted
- Gate condition and usage volume verified by Product Owner before sprint planning

---

### BLG-FEAT-34 — Trade plan P&L attribution
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Product Feature / Analytics
**Owner:** Metrics & Analytics Owner; Financial Reporting & Records Owner
**Source:** IDEA-trade-plan-20260508-02 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** M (~2–3 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** `plan_id` linkage live on closed trades (PT-05 shipped and plans actively used).

**Problem**
Closed trade P&L cannot currently be attributed back to the trade plan that governed the entry. Without `plan_id` on position records, it is impossible to compare planned R-risk vs realised R-multiple or evaluate whether adhering to a plan improved outcomes vs discretionary deviation.

**Scope**
- Link `plan_id` from trade plan to position/trade close record
- Attribution report: planned_risk_R vs realised_R per attributed trade
- Aggregate: plan-adhered trades vs plan-deviated trades outcome comparison

**Acceptance Criteria**
- `plan_id` linkage implemented on closed trades
- Attribution report computable
- Gate condition verified by Product Owner before sprint planning

---

### BLG-FEAT-35 — Entry zone discipline reporting
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Product Feature / Analytics
**Owner:** Metrics & Analytics Owner
**Source:** IDEA-trade-plan-20260508-03 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** M (~2–3 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** ≥ 20 closed trades with linked trade plans AND `entry_delta_pct` field captured on closed trades.

**Problem**
No metric tracks whether entries were executed within the planned entry zone. `entry_delta_pct` (actual entry vs planned entry midpoint) is a candidate field but is not yet captured at trade close. Without this data, it is impossible to assess entry zone discipline or its correlation with trade outcome.

**Scope**
- Capture `entry_delta_pct` on trade close: actual_entry_price vs planned_entry_zone midpoint
- Discipline metric: % of trades entering within planned zone
- Correlation: entry discipline vs R-multiple outcome

**Acceptance Criteria**
- `entry_delta_pct` captured on trade close where plan linkage exists
- Entry discipline metric computable and displayable
- Gate condition verified by Product Owner before sprint planning

### BLG-FEAT-41 — Claude thesis adoption rate metric
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Product Feature / Analytics
**Owner:** Metrics Definitions & Analytics Owner
**Source:** IDEA-metrics-analytics-20260525-02 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-25__scheduled (DL-034)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Problem**
The Claude thesis generation feature (shipped v4.0) writes to the setup_thesis field on trade plans. There is no metric tracking whether generated theses are accepted, edited, or discarded. Adoption rate is a useful early signal of feature value and cost-per-use justification.

**Scope**
- Define metric: thesis_adoption_rate = trade_plans_with_non-empty_setup_thesis_at_entry / trade_plans_with_thesis_generated
- Requires comparing claude_audit_log (thesis generated) against trade_plan final setup_thesis at position entry
- Document in metrics_definitions.md

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Metric defined in metrics_definitions.md
- Query approach documented (claude_audit_log join trade_plans)
- Reviewed by Financial Reporting & Records Owner and Product Owner

---

### BLG-FEAT-44 — Arc 5 compliance score utility advisory at low trade volume
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Product Feature / UX Advisory
**Owner:** Metrics Definitions & Analytics Owner; Head of UX & Design
**Source:** IDEA-metrics-analytics-20260601-02 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-03__scheduled (DL-038)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** Arc5ComplianceSection live 3+ months post-v4.1 ship (~Aug 2026). Minimum usage period needed to assess whether low-volume score values are misinterpreted in practice.

**Problem**
The Arc 5 composite compliance score (shipped v4.1) is computed from fewer than 20 closed trades. At low sample volumes, the score may represent statistical noise rather than actionable signal. Without a "minimum data" advisory in the UI, users may over-interpret early values.

**Scope**
- Assess whether compliance scores at <20 trades are statistically meaningful
- If noise at low volume: add a "Minimum trade history required (< 20 trades)" advisory near the score display
- Gate condition verification by Metrics Definitions & Analytics Owner before sprint planning

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Assessment document produced (advisory or advisory-not-needed conclusion)
- If advisory warranted: UI advisory added to Arc5ComplianceSection for sub-20-trade states
- Gate condition verified before sprint planning

### BLG-FEAT-45 — Monthly P&L report format review — 3-month usage retrospective
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Product Feature / Analytics
**Owner:** Financial Reporting & Records Owner
**Source:** IDEA-financial-reporting-20260607-02 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-09__scheduled (DL-041)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled
**Gate criteria:** ≥ 2026-08-05 (3+ months since Monthly P&L shipped 2026-05-05)

**Problem**
Monthly P&L shipped 2026-05-05 with a fixed column/section layout. After 3 months of real usage, the format may benefit from minor adjustments (column order, section grouping, display precision). A lightweight retrospective assessment at 3 months is appropriate before any format changes are considered.

**Scope**
- Review current Monthly P&L format against 3+ months of usage experience
- Identify any column, section, or display precision improvements
- Produce a brief recommendations document; if no changes warranted, record "no change" decision
- Product Owner sign-off

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Format review conducted with 3+ months of data available
- Recommendations document produced (or "no change" decision recorded)
- Any format changes flow into the next appropriate sprint as separate stories
- Gate condition verified: ≥ 2026-08-05

### BLG-FE-27 — Nav bar redesign exploration
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Frontend / UX Design
**Owner:** Head of UX & Design
**Source:** v3.2 delivery verification — user feedback 2026-05-06
**Effort:** M (~1–2 days design + spec)
**Provisional-Target:** Arc 3 (design exploration — not urgent; no current blocking workflow)

**Problem**
The current nav bar occupies a fixed portion of the visible screen area. As the application grows in Arc 2 and beyond, the navigation structure may benefit from a redesign to reclaim vertical space. Options to evaluate: Sticky/Fixed Header (current pattern, optimised), mega menu (grouped sections), or breadcrumb navigation (context-sensitive, minimal footprint).

**Scope**
- Head of UX & Design to evaluate the three navigation patterns in the context of current and Arc 2 page inventory
- Produce a design recommendation with rationale (no implementation required at this stage)
- If redesign is recommended, produce a UX spec and create a follow-on implementation backlog item

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Design recommendation document produced (one of: maintain current, redesign to pattern X)
- Rationale covers: screen real-estate impact, mobile responsiveness, Arc 2 page count
- If redesign: UX spec produced and implementation backlog item filed

---

### BLG-FE-39 — Arc 2 user journey map
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Frontend / UX Design
**Owner:** Head of UX & Design
**Source:** IDEA-ux-design-20260421-01 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** M (~1–2 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** PT-04 (Setup Quality Score) shipped.

**Problem**
No end-to-end user journey map exists covering the full Arc 2 flow: Screener → Watchlist → Research View → Trade Plan → Execution. As Arc 2 ships its final features, a journey map would surface UX gaps, confirm feature sequencing, and establish the baseline for Arc 3 UX planning. Requires PT-04 to be shipped so the full flow is complete before mapping.

**Scope**
- User journey map covering screener discovery → trade plan creation → execution
- Identify friction points and hand-off gaps between views
- Produce design recommendation: maintain current or file targeted UX improvement items

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Journey map document produced
- Friction points enumerated; any actionable items filed as backlog entries
- Gate condition verified by Product Owner before sprint planning

### BLG-FE-40 — Red Flag Journal filter state persistence
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Frontend / UX
**Owner:** Base44 Frontend; Head of UX & Design
**Source:** IDEA-base44-frontend-20260522-02 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-22__scheduled (DL-033)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** Red Flag Journal in active use for ≥ 30 days post-v3.9 (confirm filter persistence adds value before implementing).

**Problem**
Red Flag Journal filter state (date range, severity, rule type) resets on page reload. Users who open the RFJ daily to review recent events must re-apply their filter preferences on each visit. localStorage persistence is a standard UX pattern that reduces friction on repeat visits.

**Scope**
- Persist RFJ filter state to localStorage (date range, event type, severity if/when added)
- Version the localStorage key to handle filter schema changes gracefully
- Restore filter state on page load; clear stale state if key version mismatch

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Filter state persists across page reloads
- Stale state (version mismatch) cleared gracefully without error
- Playwright test: set filter → reload page → verify filter state restored
- Gate condition verified by Product Owner before sprint planning

### BLG-FE-43 — SI-05 Weekly Digest frontend component spec
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Frontend / Spec
**Owner:** Frontend Specs & UX Documentation Owner; Base44 Frontend
**Source:** IDEA-base44-frontend-20260522-01 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-22__scheduled (DL-033)
**Effort:** M (~1–2 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** SI-05 (Weekly Strategy Integrity Digest) sprint planning imminent.

**Problem**
SI-05 will deliver the Weekly Strategy Integrity Digest via Telegram notification and potentially an in-app view. No frontend component spec or UX spec exists for the digest display. Authoring this spec before sprint planning ensures frontend scope is clearly defined and sized — preventing mid-sprint ambiguity on rendering requirements.

**Scope**
- UX spec: digest layout, content sections (drift signal, red flag summary, compliance score trend), notification vs in-app view decision
- Component requirements document: data inputs, update frequency, display states (no data, loading, populated)
- Review against Telegram notification format constraints (v2.4 weekly digest pattern)

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Frontend component spec and UX spec produced and filed
- Component requirements document covers all SI-05 data inputs
- Spec reviewed by Product Owner and Head of UX & Design before sprint planning
- Gate condition verified before sprint planning

### BLG-FE-45 — Arc5ComplianceSection layout expandability review
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Frontend / UX
**Owner:** Base44 Frontend; Head of UX & Design
**Source:** IDEA-base44-frontend-20260525-01 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-25__scheduled (DL-034)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** v4.1 sprint planning complete — layout expandability review requires knowing which Arc 6 compliance data points will be added to the PerformanceAnalytics page.

**Problem**
Arc5ComplianceSection.js (shipped v4.0) displays 5 compliance metrics. Arc 6 will add performance science metrics to the same analytics surface. Without an expandability review, the component layout may require significant rework when additional data sections are added. A pre-sprint review ensures the component is structurally extensible.

**Scope**
- Review Arc5ComplianceSection layout for extensibility: grid, card count, responsive breakpoints
- Identify layout constraints that would prevent additional section additions
- Produce short design note with recommendations (retain, refactor, or modularise)

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Design note produced and reviewed by Product Owner
- Gate condition verified before sprint planning

### BLG-FE-46 — Claude thesis generation user feedback mechanism
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Frontend / UX
**Owner:** Base44 Frontend; Head of UX & Design
**Source:** IDEA-base44-frontend-20260525-02 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-25__scheduled (DL-034)
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Problem**
The Claude thesis generation button (shipped v4.0) produces a thesis and populates the setup_thesis field. There is no feedback mechanism: the user cannot signal whether the generated thesis was useful, edited heavily, or discarded. Without feedback, the system cannot track thesis quality or improve prompt engineering over time.

**Scope**
- Simple feedback UI on thesis generation: "Useful / Not useful" binary or a brief edit indicator
- Data stored in claude_audit_log or a lightweight feedback table
- Does not require a full feedback loop — MVP is a binary signal

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Feedback mechanism available after thesis generation
- Feedback data persisted (table or audit log field)
- UX reviewed by Head of UX & Design before sprint planning

### BLG-FE-54 — Arc 5 unified pre-entry gateway
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Frontend / UX Exploration
**Owner:** Frontend Specs & UX Documentation Owner; Head of UX & Design
**Source:** IDEA-frontend-ux-20260522-01 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-27__scheduled (DL-035, 3-cycle cap)
**Effort:** M (~2–3 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** Arc 5 fully complete (SI-02, SI-04, SI-05 all shipped).

**Problem**
SI-01 (pre-entry validation panel) and PT-05 (entry checklist) are separate views requiring multi-view navigation before trade finalisation. A unified pre-entry gateway combining all required checks into a single screen could reduce friction and navigation complexity. Gate ensures design is informed by the complete Arc 5 feature set.

**Scope**
- Explore combining SI-01 and PT-05 into a single pre-entry gateway screen
- Map decision points and information needs for the combined flow
- Propose structural changes; not a committed sprint item until gate clears

**Acceptance Criteria**
- UX exploration document produced
- Combined flow mapped with clear decision points
- Gate condition (Arc 5 fully complete) verified before commencing

### BLG-FE-55 — Mobile responsiveness baseline assessment
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Frontend / UX Quality
**Owner:** Head of UX & Design
**Source:** IDEA-head-of-ux-20260522-02 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-27__scheduled (DL-035, 3-cycle cap)
**Effort:** M (~1–2 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** Arc 5 fully complete (feature set stabilised — SI-02, SI-04, SI-05 all shipped).

**Problem**
No formal mobile responsiveness testing has been performed. The most frequently used views (positions, screener, trade plan form, Red Flag Journal) have been built for desktop-first usage. Assessing mobile responsiveness after Arc 5 closes the feature set provides a stable baseline before any mobile polish work.

**Scope**
- Identify most-used views from user behaviour observation
- Assess mobile responsiveness for each identified view
- Produce assessment report with severity-ranked findings

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Mobile responsiveness assessment report produced
- Views assessed: at minimum positions, screener, trade plan form, Red Flag Journal
- Gate condition verified before commencing

### BLG-FE-58 — Pre-entry panel: check grouping for Arc 5 expansion
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Frontend / UX Improvement
**Owner:** Head of UX & Design; Frontend Specs & UX Documentation Owner
**Source:** docs/product/ux/pre_entry_panel_ux_assessment.md — candidate P4 — cycle 2026-05-31__release-v4.7 (ST-09)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** SI-02 or SI-04 sprint planning initiated (Arc 5 expansion imminent).

**Problem**
PreEntryValidationPanel currently displays 5 checks in a flat list. As SI-02 drift detection and SI-04 strategy version comparison add compliance context to the pre-entry flow, check count may grow to 8–10+ items. A flat list at that scale is dense and unscannable.

**Scope**
- Group checks into labelled sections: "Compliance" (Arc 5 checks), "Risk" (cash, sizing), "Technical" (regime, earnings)
- Section headers use small separator labels; no collapsible sub-groups required
- Prepare component structure for Arc 5 check additions before SI-02/SI-04 ship

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Checks grouped into at minimum 2 sections (Compliance and Risk/Technical)
- Grouping does not break existing override acknowledgement behaviour
- Gate condition (SI-02 or SI-04 sprint planning) verified before commencing

### BLG-FE-59 — Arc5ComplianceSection extension spec for SI-02/SI-04
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Frontend / Spec
**Owner:** Frontend Specs & UX Documentation Owner; Base44 Frontend
**Source:** IDEA-frontend-ux-20260527-02 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-06-02__scheduled (DL-037; terminal Parked-cycle-2 disposition)
**Effort:** M (~1–2 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** SI-02 frontend + SI-04 sprint planning imminent (both Arc 5 features approaching their sprint entry).

**Problem**
Arc5ComplianceSection.js (shipped v4.0) displays 5 compliance metrics. SI-02 drift detection frontend and SI-04 strategy version comparison will each add new display cards to this section. Without extension point specifications defined in advance, each addition will require layout redesign rather than slotting into a prepared contract. Pre-specifying card layout contracts prevents rework.

**Scope**
- Update BLG-FE-48 spec (if exists) or author new: extension point specifications for SI-02 drift score card and SI-04 version comparison card
- Define card layout contract: minimum data fields, display states (loading, populated, gate-not-met), responsive breakpoints
- Ensure additions require no Arc5ComplianceSection.js layout redesign

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Extension spec document produced covering SI-02 and SI-04 card requirements
- Card layout contract defines all required display states
- Gate conditions (both SI-02 frontend + SI-04 sprint planning imminent) verified before commencing

### BLG-FE-62 — Pre-entry panel combined component specification (BLG-FE-56/57/58)
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Frontend / Spec
**Owner:** Frontend Specs & UX Documentation Owner; Base44 Frontend Prompt Owner
**Source:** IDEA-base44-frontend-20260601-02 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-03__scheduled (DL-038; gate cleared: BLG-GOV-87 shipped v5.0)
**Effort:** M (~1–2 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** BLG-FE-56/57/58 sprint planning imminent; SI-02 frontend activation triggered (20+ closed trades confirmed). BLG-GOV-87 re-entry criteria shipped v5.0 — functional activation gate still pending.

**Problem**
BLG-FE-56 (warn/fail override separation), BLG-FE-57 (count badge when collapsed), and BLG-FE-58 (check grouping for Arc 5) are three interdependent PreEntryValidationPanel improvements. Specifying them individually risks fragmented UX implementation. A combined specification aligns all three changes before sprint planning seals.

**Scope**
- Combined component spec covering all three BLG-FE-56/57/58 improvements as a coherent design
- Map interaction dependencies (e.g., grouping in BLG-FE-58 affects badge count in BLG-FE-57)
- Input to sprint planning when gate triggers; replaces need for three separate spec documents

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Combined component spec produced and reviewed by Head of UX & Design
- All three BLG-FE-56/57/58 scopes covered in a single document
- Gate condition verified before sprint planning

### BLG-FE-63 — Arc 5 completion visual consistency pre-review
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Frontend / UX Design
**Owner:** Head of UX & Design; Frontend Specs & UX Documentation Owner
**Source:** IDEA-head-of-ux-20260601-01 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-03__scheduled (DL-038; gate cleared: BLG-GOV-88 shipped v5.0)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** SI-04 sprint planning imminent. BLG-GOV-88 binding conditions shipped v5.0; SI-04 is in Later horizon — gate triggers when SI-04 enters sprint planning.

**Problem**
SI-04 (strategy version comparison) and SI-05 (weekly digest display) will introduce new panels to the Arc 5 UI surface. No review of the existing Arc 5 design vocabulary (Pre-Entry panel, Red Flag Journal, Arc5ComplianceSection) has been done to ensure consistency before these additions begin. A pre-review before SI-04 implementation prevents retroactive consistency fixes.

**Scope**
- Review existing Arc 5 panel design patterns (colour, typography, layout, empty states)
- Identify consistency vocabulary: what patterns to carry forward to SI-04/SI-05 panels
- Produce short design vocabulary note; no implementation required

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Design vocabulary note produced covering existing Arc 5 panels
- Consistency patterns identified; input to SI-04/SI-05 sprint planning
- Gate condition verified before sprint planning

### BLG-FE-65 — User journey map: SI-05 Telegram digest to app action
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Frontend / UX Research
**Owner:** Head of UX & Design
**Source:** IDEA-head-of-ux-20260607-02 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-07__scheduled (DL-039)
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled
**Displacement:** BLG-FE-55 (mobile responsiveness baseline, P3, gate-conditional) deprioritised.

**Problem**
SI-05 Phase 1 introduces a new workflow pattern: the user receives a Telegram notification (weekly digest) and then takes an action in the app (review Red Flag Journal, check compliance score, adjust behaviour). This is the first push notification → app action flow in the system. Friction mapping this journey surfaces improvements before SI-05 Phase 2 scope is defined.

**Scope**
- Map the user journey from receiving the SI-05 digest to completing an in-app action
- Identify: entry points (what links are in the digest), navigation steps to the relevant app screen, any friction encountered
- Produce a brief journey map document with friction findings; file follow-up backlog items if significant friction discovered

**Acceptance Criteria**
- User journey map document produced
- Entry points and navigation steps documented
- Friction findings enumerated; any significant friction filed as a separate backlog item
- Head of UX & Design sign-off

### BLG-FE-66 — RFJ date-range filter (date-to field)
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Frontend / UX Refinement
**Owner:** Head of UX & Design; Base44 Frontend Prompt Owner
**Source:** ST-07 RFJ visual design review — filed 2026-06-22 (cycle 2026-06-19__release-v6.0)
**Effort:** XS
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled
**Gate criteria:** Event volume makes date-from-only filtering insufficient for review workflows.

**Problem**
The Red Flag Journal filter panel supports a "From date" input only. A growing journal has no upper date bound — a user reviewing "last month's" events cannot scope the view to a period. At current low event volume this is acceptable, but will become limiting as the journal grows.

**Scope**
- Add a "To date" input to the RFJ filter panel
- Update `GET /portfolio/red-flag-journal` to accept an optional `until` parameter
- Convert current date-from-only filter to a date range (from + to)

**Acceptance Criteria**
- "To date" filter input present in filter panel
- Results are scoped to [date-from, date-to] when both are set
- "Clear filters" clears both date inputs
- Existing "From date" behaviour unchanged when "To date" is not set

### BLG-FE-67 — RFJ event type colour palette refinement
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Frontend / Cosmetic / Accessibility
**Owner:** Head of UX & Design; Base44 Frontend Prompt Owner
**Source:** ST-07 RFJ visual design review — filed 2026-06-22 (cycle 2026-06-19__release-v6.0)
**Effort:** XS
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Problem**
The Red Flag Journal uses four warm-spectrum colours (amber-400, orange-400, red-400, rose-400) that are semantically arbitrary and difficult to distinguish under the `light-daltonized` theme. The colour for `checklist_skipped` (orange-400) blends with risk-event colours, and `drawdown_prompt_dismissed` (rose-400) is perceptually similar to `stop_prompt_dismissed` (red-400).

**Scope**
- Update `EVENT_TYPE_CONFIG` in `src/pages/RedFlagJournal.js`:
  - `checklist_skipped`: `orange-400` → `sky-400` (administrative miss, not a risk event)
  - `drawdown_prompt_dismissed`: `rose-400` → `red-500` (deeper risk signal, distinguishable from red-400)
- No other changes required (icons, layout, data model unchanged)

**Acceptance Criteria**
- `checklist_skipped` renders with `sky-400` colour indicator
- `drawdown_prompt_dismissed` renders with `red-500` colour indicator
- Other two event types (amber-400, red-400) unchanged
- Colours visible and semantically distinct under `light-daltonized` theme

### BLG-FE-68 — Arc 5 compliance score sparkline trend chart (gate-conditional)
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Frontend / Analytics Display
**Owner:** Metrics Definitions & Analytics Owner; Base44 Frontend Prompt Owner
**Source:** IDEA-metrics-analytics-20260607-02 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-09__scheduled (DL-041)
**Effort:** M (~2 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled
**Gate criteria:** BLG-FE-45 (Arc5ComplianceSection layout expandability review) complete

**Problem**
The Arc 5 compliance score is displayed as a single value on the compliance section. A sparkline trend chart showing the score's trajectory over recent weeks would help identify improving or degrading compliance at a glance. The gate is BLG-FE-45 — adding widgets to Arc5ComplianceSection before the layout expandability review is premature.

**Scope**
- Add sparkline trend chart to Arc5ComplianceSection (or equivalent compliance view)
- Data source: existing compliance score history endpoint or new rolling-window endpoint
- Chart shows last 8–12 weeks of compliance scores
- BLG-FE-45 must be complete before this enters sprint planning

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Sparkline chart renders in compliance section
- Data sourced from a defined endpoint (not mocked)
- Gate condition (BLG-FE-45) verified before sprint planning
- Playwright: chart renders with data; empty state handled

### BLG-FE-69 — SI-05 in-app digest panel — read-only last-sent view (gate-conditional)
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Frontend / Notification Display
**Owner:** Base44 Frontend Prompt Owner; Frontend Specs & UX Documentation Owner
**Source:** IDEA-base44-frontend-20260607-01 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-09__scheduled (DL-041)
**Effort:** M (~2–3 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled
**Gate criteria:** Phase 2 channel decision (BLG-GOV-92 SI-05 Phase 2 activation criteria) — if Telegram remains the sole channel, this item is not required

**Problem**
SI-05 weekly digest is delivered via Telegram (v5.1). Users who miss a Telegram message have no way to retrieve the last digest content from within the app. An in-app read-only panel showing the last-sent digest content would provide a fallback reference point. However, this is premature until the Phase 2 channel decision confirms an in-app component is warranted.

**Scope**
- Read-only digest panel in Settings or a new SI-05 section
- Shows last digest sent: date, content summary, link counts
- No composition or editing — display only
- Phase 2 channel decision must be made before sprint planning

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Panel renders last-sent digest content
- Date and delivery status visible
- Gate condition (BLG-GOV-92 Phase 2 decision) verified before sprint planning

### BLG-FE-70 — Compliance score trend widget on dashboard homepage (gate-conditional)
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Frontend / Dashboard
**Owner:** Base44 Frontend Prompt Owner; Head of UX & Design
**Source:** IDEA-base44-frontend-20260607-02 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-09__scheduled (DL-041)
**Effort:** M (~2 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled
**Gate criteria:** BLG-FE-45 (Arc5ComplianceSection layout expandability review) complete

**Problem**
Dashboard homepage shows key portfolio metrics but not the Arc 5 compliance score trend. A small trend widget on the homepage would surface compliance trajectory without requiring navigation to the full compliance section. Gate is BLG-FE-45 — homepage widget additions should follow the expandability assessment.

**Scope**
- Small compliance score trend widget on dashboard homepage
- Shows current score + trend arrow (up/down/flat vs prior week)
- Links to full Arc5ComplianceSection
- BLG-FE-45 must be complete before this enters sprint planning

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Widget renders on dashboard with current score and trend indicator
- Links correctly to full compliance section
- Gate condition (BLG-FE-45) verified before sprint planning

### BLG-FE-71 — SI-05 in-app digest UX spec — Phase 2 potential (gate-conditional)
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Frontend Spec / UX
**Owner:** Frontend Specs & UX Documentation Owner; Head of UX & Design
**Source:** IDEA-frontend-ux-20260607-02 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-09__scheduled (DL-041)
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled
**Gate criteria:** Phase 2 channel decision (BLG-GOV-92) — if in-app delivery is confirmed for Phase 2, this spec should precede implementation

**Problem**
If SI-05 Phase 2 includes an in-app delivery channel, a UX spec will be required before frontend implementation begins. Authoring the spec before the Phase 2 channel decision is premature — the spec scope depends entirely on which channel(s) Phase 2 targets.

**Scope**
- Interaction pattern for SI-05 digest delivery in-app (read, dismiss, archive)
- Visual design: notification panel, badge indicators, read/unread states
- Produced only if Phase 2 channel decision confirms in-app component
- Must be completed before BLG-FE-69 sprint planning

**Acceptance Criteria**
- UX spec produced covering interaction patterns and visual design
- Reviewed by Head of UX & Design and Frontend Specs & UX Documentation Owner
- Gate condition (BLG-GOV-92) verified before authoring

### BLG-BE-13 — Screener result history table
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Backend Engineering
**Owner:** Head of Backend Engineering
**Source:** IDEA-backend-20260421-01 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** M (~2–3 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** Screener live ≥ 60 days (sufficient history to make a queryable history table valuable).

**Problem**
Each screener run overwrites or appends to the current results without a queryable historical table. After 60 days, trend analysis (how screener output has evolved over time) becomes valuable but requires a properly structured history table with per-run metadata (run_timestamp, run_id, ticker count, pass count, regime distribution). Without this, historical comparison is not possible.

**Scope**
- `screener_run_history` table: run_id, run_timestamp, total_tickers, pass_count, regime_distribution JSON
- `GET /screener/history` endpoint returning run history with pagination
- Backfill not required; populate from next run forward

**Acceptance Criteria**
- History table created and populated on each screener run
- `GET /screener/history` returns paginated run history
- Gate condition verified by Product Owner before sprint planning

### BLG-BE-14 — Trade plan schema versioning
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Backend Engineering
**Owner:** Head of Backend Engineering; Head of Specs Team
**Source:** IDEA-backend-20260421-02 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** M (~2–3 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** ≥ 3 new fields added to trade plan schema after v3.4 baseline (indicating schema churn warrants versioning overhead).

**Problem**
Trade plan schema has grown incrementally. If the schema continues to change at pace (new fields, deprecated fields), reading old plans stored under prior schema versions becomes an issue. Schema versioning adds a `schema_version` field to each trade plan record, enabling readers to apply the correct transformation for older records. Gate ensures the overhead is warranted before introducing this complexity.

**Scope**
- Add `schema_version` field to trade plan records (default: current version)
- Transformation layer: when reading plans, apply version-appropriate defaults for missing fields
- Migration: backfill existing plans with baseline schema_version

**Acceptance Criteria**
- `schema_version` field present on all trade plan records
- Read path applies correct field defaults for legacy records
- Gate condition (≥3 new fields post v3.4) verified by Product Owner before sprint planning

### BLG-BE-21 — Arc 5 analytics endpoint versioning strategy
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Backend / API Design
**Owner:** Head of Backend Engineering; API Contracts Documentation Owner
**Source:** IDEA-backend-engineering-20260525-02 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-25__scheduled (DL-034)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** Arc 6 planning trigger — analytics endpoint versioning strategy needed when Arc 6 analytics endpoints are being designed alongside existing Arc 5 endpoints.

**Problem**
GET /analytics/arc5-compliance (shipped v4.0) and future Arc 6 analytics endpoints will coexist on the same service. Without an explicit versioning and naming convention, Arc 6 additions may collide with or shadow Arc 5 endpoints. A versioning strategy (path prefix, query param, or response envelope version) must be decided before Arc 6 sprint planning.

**Scope**
- Define endpoint versioning convention for analytics namespace
- Assess whether current /analytics/ prefix is extensible or requires refactoring
- Input to Arc 6 analytics endpoint design

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Versioning strategy documented in API design notes or openapi.yaml preamble
- Reviewed by API Contracts Documentation Owner and Head of Specs Team
- Gate condition (Arc 6 planning trigger) verified before commencing

### BLG-BE-24 — Red flag events retention policy
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Backend / Data Lifecycle
**Owner:** Head of Backend Engineering; Infrastructure & Operations Owner
**Source:** IDEA-backend-engineering-20260522-02 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-27__scheduled (DL-035, 3-cycle cap)
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** red_flag_events table 6+ months old (post 2026-11-22).

**Problem**
The red_flag_events table has no defined data retention policy. As override events accumulate over months, query performance may degrade without indexes and archiving strategy. Defining a retention policy before the table requires unplanned maintenance is standard operational hygiene.

**Scope**
- Define minimum required event fields for retention
- Define archiving cadence (e.g. events older than 12 months archived to cold storage)
- Define query performance thresholds that trigger archiving review
- Document policy in ops notes

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Retention policy document produced
- Archiving cadence defined
- Gate condition (table 6+ months old) verified before commencing

### BLG-BE-27 — SI-02 drift service query performance baseline
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Backend Engineering / Performance
**Owner:** Backend Engineering Patterns Owner; Head of Engineering
**Source:** IDEA-backend-engineering-20260601-01 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-03__scheduled (DL-038)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** SI-02 frontend sprint planning triggered; 20+ closed trades confirmed (BLG-GOV-87 re-entry criteria shipped v5.0 — functional activation still pending trade count gate).

**Problem**
The SI-02 drift service (shipped v4.6) uses window functions over trade_history and trade_plans. With only 6 closed trades, current query volume is too low to surface meaningful index gaps. A performance baseline at activation volume (20+ trades) establishes the query cost before concurrent frontend load is introduced.

**Scope**
- Run drift score queries against staging at 20+ trade volume
- Record p50/p95 query latency per metric (early_entry_rate, momentum_override_rate, losing_streak_sizing, regime_deviation_rate)
- Identify indexes required to maintain sub-200ms response at projected load

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Performance baseline document produced for all 4 drift metric queries
- Indexes identified and filed as implementation items if needed
- Gate condition verified before sprint planning

### BLG-BE-28 — Arc 4 PO-03 behavioral pattern storage pre-design
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Backend Engineering / Data Model
**Owner:** Backend Engineering Patterns Owner; Data Model, Domain & Schema Owner
**Source:** IDEA-backend-engineering-20260601-02 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-03__scheduled (DL-038)
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** PO-02 gate met (6+ months AI journal entries ~Oct 2026) + Arc 4 sprint planning triggered.

**Problem**
PO-03 (Behavioural Error Taxonomy) requires a new classification table and error_type enum. Pre-designing the schema before Arc 4 sprint planning prevents same-sprint data model debt (pattern observed in v3.3 IT-01/02/03 backend split).

**Scope**
- Define error_type enum values (entry_too_early, sized_incorrectly, ignored_regime, held_too_long, etc.)
- Define behavioral_errors table schema (id, trade_id, journal_entry_id, error_type, notes, detected_at)
- Pre-design migration strategy; no implementation until Arc 4 sprint

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Schema pre-design document produced
- error_type enum values defined and reviewed by Metrics Definitions & Analytics Owner
- Gate condition verified before sprint planning

### BLG-BE-29 — Database index review for SI-02 drift queries
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Backend Engineering / Performance
**Owner:** Head of Engineering; Backend Engineering Patterns Owner
**Source:** IDEA-head-of-engineering-20260601-01 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-03__scheduled (DL-038)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** SI-02 frontend sprint planning triggered; 20+ closed trades confirmed. To be completed alongside or immediately after BLG-BE-27.

**Problem**
SI-02 drift service queries trade_plans and trade_history with window functions and date-range filters. Appropriate indexes must be confirmed before frontend activation adds concurrent load. BLG-BE-27 establishes the baseline; this item implements any gaps found.

**Scope**
- Review current indexes on trade_plans (signal_id, entry_date, exit_date) and trade_history (trade_id, close_date)
- Add indexes identified as missing from BLG-BE-27 performance baseline
- Verify drift score queries benefit from new indexes via EXPLAIN ANALYZE

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Index gaps identified and addressed
- EXPLAIN ANALYZE output confirms index usage for all drift metric queries
- Gate condition verified before sprint planning

### BLG-BE-30 — SI-04 schema requirements pre-design
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Backend Engineering / Data Model
**Owner:** Data Model, Domain & Schema Owner; Backend Engineering Patterns Owner
**Source:** IDEA-data-model-20260601-01 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-03__scheduled (DL-038; gate cleared: BLG-GOV-88 shipped v5.0)
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** SI-04 sprint planning imminent. BLG-GOV-88 binding conditions shipped v5.0 — next gate is active sprint planning for SI-04 (Later horizon).

**Problem**
SI-04 strategy version comparison requires linking trade_plans to historical strategy_rules.md versions. Whether this is a new strategy_versions table, a foreign key, or a snapshot field must be decided before SI-04 sprint to avoid same-sprint data model debt. BLG-SPEC-43 (API contract) exists; data model pre-design is the remaining gap.

**Scope**
- Evaluate three schema options: new table (strategy_versions), FK on trade_plans (strategy_version), snapshot field (strategy_snapshot JSON)
- Recommend approach with rationale (versioning overhead vs query simplicity)
- Define migration path for existing trade_plans (backfill strategy)

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Schema pre-design document produced with recommended approach
- Reviewed by Data Model, Domain & Schema Owner and Strategy Rules & System Intent Owner
- Gate condition verified before sprint planning

### BLG-BE-31 — Arc 4 PO-04 reflection-outcome correlation data prerequisites
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Backend Engineering / Data Model
**Owner:** Data Model, Domain & Schema Owner; Backend Engineering Patterns Owner
**Source:** IDEA-data-model-20260601-02 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-03__scheduled (DL-038)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** PO-02 gate met + Arc 4 sprint planning triggered (~Oct-Dec 2026).

**Problem**
PO-04 (Reflection ↔ Outcome Correlation) requires journal entries with quantified reflection depth scores linked to trade outcomes. Neither reflection depth scoring nor the linkage from journal_entries to trade outcomes is currently captured. A data prerequisites assessment determines whether new fields are needed before Arc 4 sprint planning.

**Scope**
- Assess current journal_entries and trade_history data models for PO-04 readiness
- Identify new fields required: reflection_depth_score, journal_entry_id on trade_history, etc.
- Document prerequisites; no implementation until Arc 4 sprint

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Data prerequisites assessment document produced
- New fields required for PO-04 identified and estimated
- Gate condition verified before sprint planning

### BLG-QA-21 — Arc 2 end-to-end QA protocol
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** QA / Test Coverage
**Owner:** QA Lead
**Source:** IDEA-qa-20260421-01 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** M (~2 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** PT-04 (Setup Quality Score) shipped — Arc 2 feature set complete.

**Problem**
No consolidated end-to-end QA protocol covers the full Arc 2 feature set (Screener, Research View, Trade Plan, Setup Quality Score). Individual EPICs have per-story DoQ sign-offs, but there is no arc-level protocol that exercises the full workflow from screener discovery to closed trade with a quality score. Such a protocol is most valuable once Arc 2 is complete.

**Scope**
- Arc-level E2E test protocol document covering full Arc 2 flow
- Playwright automation for the core arc-level happy path
- Manual checklist for Arc 2 edge cases not covered by Playwright

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Arc 2 E2E protocol document produced and filed in `docs/qa/`
- Core happy path covered by Playwright
- Gate condition verified by QA Lead and Product Owner before sprint planning

### BLG-QA-22 — Arc 2 DoQ standards review
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** QA / Governance
**Owner:** QA Lead; Head of Specs Team
**Source:** IDEA-qa-20260421-02 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** PT-04 (Setup Quality Score) shipped — Arc 2 feature set complete.

**Problem**
DoQ standards (shared_standards.md §DoQ) were established in Arc 1 and have evolved incrementally. Arc 2 introduced new feature types (research views, AI-assisted UX, trade plans) that may expose gaps in the existing DoQ rubric. A targeted review of DoQ standards against Arc 2 artefacts will ensure the standards remain fit for Arc 3 and beyond.

**Scope**
- Review DoQ standards against Arc 2 EPIC QA evidence files
- Identify any rubric gaps introduced by Arc 2 feature types
- Propose amendments to `shared_standards.md` DoQ section if warranted

**Acceptance Criteria**
- DoQ standards reviewed; gaps (if any) documented
- If amendments warranted: `shared_standards.md` updated per §6 governance checklist
- Gate condition verified before sprint planning

**Gate criteria:** PT-04 (Setup Quality Score) shipped.

**Problem**
No Playwright test covers the full trade plan lifecycle: create → edit → link to position → close → view in plan-vs-reality. Individual story tests cover creation and display, but lifecycle continuity (plan survives position link, quality score visible at creation, plan-vs-reality renders post-close) is not tested end-to-end. PT-04 must be shipped to make the quality-score step part of the lifecycle.

**Scope**
- Playwright E2E test: create plan with quality score visible → link to position → close position → verify plan-vs-reality
- Cover: plan state transitions, quality score persistence, plan-vs-reality accuracy

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Full lifecycle Playwright test authored and passing in CI
- Gate condition verified by QA Lead and Product Owner before sprint planning

### BLG-QA-26 — Arc 5 QA protocol
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** QA / Test Coverage
**Owner:** Director of Quality; QA Lead
**Source:** IDEA-director-of-quality-20260522-01 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-22__scheduled (DL-033)
**Effort:** M (~2 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** Arc 5 fully complete per BLG-QA-45 criteria (docs/qa/arc5_qa_completion_criteria.md): SI-01 ✅, SI-02 backend ✅, SI-03 ✅, SI-05 Phase 1 ✅, BLG-QA-49 coverage assessment ✅. SI-02 frontend, SI-04, and SI-05 Phase 2 explicitly excluded from trigger. Updated 2026-06-16 (ST-09 v5.6).

**Problem**
SI-01 through SI-03 shipped across v3.8 and v3.9. Each sprint produced per-story DoQ sign-offs but no arc-level QA protocol exists covering the full Arc 5 feature set end-to-end. Once all five features ship, an arc-level protocol analogous to BLG-QA-21 (Arc 2 E2E QA protocol) will ensure the complete Strategy Integrity workflow is tested holistically.

**Scope**
- Arc-level E2E test protocol document covering full Arc 5 flow: validation gate → override event → red flag journal → drift detection review → strategy version comparison → weekly digest
- Playwright automation for the arc-level happy path
- Manual checklist for Arc 5 edge cases not covered by Playwright
- Filed in `docs/qa/arc5_qa_protocol.md`

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Arc 5 E2E protocol document produced and filed
- Core happy path covered by Playwright
- Gate condition verified by QA Lead and Product Owner before sprint planning

### BLG-QA-42 — SI-02 E2E Playwright test strategy and scaffold
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** QA / Test Coverage
**Owner:** Director of Quality; QA Lead
**Source:** IDEA-director-of-quality-20260601-01 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-03__scheduled (DL-038)
**Effort:** M (~1–2 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** SI-02 frontend sprint planning triggered; 20+ closed trades confirmed. BLG-QA-37 (Playwright mock strategy for drift features, shipped v4.2) defines the approach — this item implements it.

**Problem**
SI-02 drift service (35 unit tests, shipped v4.6) has no E2E Playwright coverage. When the frontend ships (~2027-Q1), test coverage must be ready immediately. Pre-building the scaffold 1–2 cycles before activation avoids rushed test creation under sprint pressure.

**Scope**
- Define E2E test strategy for GET /analytics/behavioural-drift (per BLG-QA-37 Playwright mock strategy)
- Scaffold Playwright test file with scenarios: drift scores render, gate-not-met state, all 4 metric cards display
- Confirm mock data approach (per BLG-QA-37 mock strategy)

**Acceptance Criteria**
- E2E test strategy document produced
- Playwright test scaffold created and passing against mock data
- All 4 drift metric display scenarios covered
- Gate condition verified before sprint planning

### BLG-QA-44 — SI-04 test planning requirements definition
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** QA / Test Planning
**Owner:** QA Lead; Director of Quality
**Source:** IDEA-qa-lead-20260601-02 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-03__scheduled (DL-038; gate cleared: BLG-GOV-88 shipped v5.0)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** SI-04 sprint planning imminent. BLG-GOV-88 binding conditions shipped v5.0 — functional activation gate is SI-04 entering sprint planning (Later horizon).

**Problem**
SI-04 (strategy version comparison) requires test coverage across: unit tests (version comparison logic), integration tests (trade_plans version linkage), and Playwright (version diff display). Defining test requirements before sprint planning ensures test scope is clear and prevents test debt analogous to BLG-QA-24 (Yahoo Finance backoff).

**Scope**
- Define unit test requirements: version comparison logic, version not found case
- Define integration test requirements: trade_plans version linkage correctness
- Define Playwright scenario requirements: version diff display, empty state, gate-not-met
- Estimate test effort; input to sprint sizing

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Test requirements document produced covering all three test tiers
- Playwright scenario outlines defined
- Gate condition verified before sprint planning

### BLG-QA-55 — SI-02 Playwright scaffold readiness assessment (gate-conditional)
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** QA / Test Planning
**Owner:** QA & Testing Owner; Director of Quality
**Source:** IDEA-qa-testing-20260607-02 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-09__scheduled (DL-041)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled
**Gate criteria:** ≥20 closed trades confirmed (same gate as SI-02 frontend activation — BLG-QA-42)

**Problem**
BLG-QA-42 (SI-02 Playwright scaffold) is gated on 20+ closed trades. When that gate clears and SI-02 frontend enters sprint planning, a readiness assessment of the BLG-QA-42 scaffold design should confirm it still reflects the final drift service implementation (which may have evolved since BLG-QA-42 was authored). This assessment prevents outdated scaffold assumptions from entering sprint planning.

**Scope**
- Review BLG-QA-42 Playwright pre-design against the final GET /analytics/behavioural-drift response schema
- Confirm mock strategy is still valid or update scaffold design
- Produce brief readiness confirmation document
- Gate: 20+ closed trades must be confirmed before this assessment is commissioned

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Scaffold design reviewed against current drift endpoint response schema
- Assessment confirms "proceed with BLG-QA-42 as-is" or produces a revision document
- Director of Quality sign-off
- Gate condition verified (≥20 closed trades)

### BLG-OPS-13 — Add new v2.8/v2.9/v3.0/v3.4/v3.9/v4.6 endpoints to api_performance_baseline.md re-run
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Operations / Performance Baseline
**Owner:** Infrastructure & Operations Owner
**Source:** v2.9 post-ship closure 2026-04-24 (3 endpoints); v3.0 post-ship closure 2026-04-28 OA-v30-01 (5 additional endpoints); v3.1 post-ship closure 2026-05-05 (10 additional endpoints); v3.4 post-ship closure 2026-05-14 (2 additional endpoints); v3.5 post-ship closure 2026-05-15 (2 additional endpoints); v3.9 post-ship closure 2026-05-22 (1 additional endpoint: GET /portfolio/red-flag-journal); v4.6 post-ship closure 2026-05-31 (1 additional endpoint: GET /analytics/behavioural-drift)
**Effort:** M (~2 days — 24 endpoints total)
**Provisional-Target:** Before next performance baseline review

**Problem**
Twenty-two endpoints shipped in v2.8/v2.9/v3.0/v3.1/v3.4/v3.5 are absent from `docs/ops/api_performance_baseline.md`. Performance re-runs require a live environment and human coordination — baseline updates cannot be automated.

**Scope (updated 2026-05-31):**
- v2.8/v2.9 endpoints (3): `POST /ai/journal-summary`, `GET /ai/journal-summary/history`, `GET /v1beta1/news`
- v3.0 endpoints (5): `GET /ticker-universe`, `POST /ticker-universe`, `DELETE /ticker-universe/{ticker}`, `GET /screener/results`, `POST /screener/run`
- v3.1 endpoints (10): `POST /trade-plans`, `GET /trade-plans/{id}`, `PUT /trade-plans/{id}`, `DELETE /trade-plans/{id}`, `GET /trade-plans/by-position/{position_id}`, `GET /trade-plans/by-ticker/{ticker}`, `GET /research/{ticker}`, `GET /earnings/{ticker}`, `GET /reports/monthly-pnl`, plus any additional v3.1 routes
- v3.4 endpoints (2): `GET /portfolio/drawdown-status`, `GET /portfolio/concentration-status`
- v3.5 endpoints (2): `GET /portfolio/paper-positions`, `GET /trades/{trade_id}/plan-vs-reality`
- v3.9 endpoints (1): `GET /portfolio/red-flag-journal`
- v4.6 endpoints (1): `GET /analytics/behavioural-drift`
- Run each against staging to obtain p50/p95 latencies and add to `docs/ops/api_performance_baseline.md`

**Acceptance Criteria**
- All 24 endpoints have p50 and p95 latency entries in the baseline document
- Entries consistent with existing baseline measurement methodology

### BLG-OPS-17 — Alpaca API cost monitoring
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Operations / Cost Monitoring
**Owner:** Infrastructure & Operations Owner
**Source:** IDEA-ops-20260421-01 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** Screener live ≥ 60 days (sufficient history to establish a meaningful cost baseline).

**Problem**
Alpaca API call volume (paper-positions, orders, account data) is not tracked. After 60 days of screener and research operations, a cost-per-run baseline can be established. Without a baseline, it is impossible to detect cost regressions when new features or higher screener frequency are introduced.

**Scope**
- Instrument Alpaca API call count per endpoint per day
- Log to `api_cost_log` or equivalent structured log
- Daily/weekly aggregate report

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Alpaca API call count logged per endpoint per run
- Aggregate report computable
- Gate condition verified by Infrastructure & Operations Owner before sprint planning

---

### BLG-OPS-18 — Data pipeline cost baseline
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Operations / Cost Monitoring
**Owner:** Infrastructure & Operations Owner
**Source:** IDEA-ops-20260421-02 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** BLG-OPS-17 complete (Alpaca cost monitoring instrumented).

**Problem**
No aggregate data pipeline cost baseline exists covering Alpaca, Yahoo Finance, and news API calls together. Once Alpaca is instrumented (BLG-OPS-17), a combined baseline across all external data dependencies can be produced. Without this, cost anomalies across the pipeline are invisible.

**Scope**
- Aggregate cost baseline: Alpaca + YF + news API per week
- Baseline document filed in `docs/ops/`
- Alert threshold definition: >2× baseline triggers advisory

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Combined pipeline cost baseline document produced
- Alert threshold defined
- Gate condition (BLG-OPS-17 complete) verified before sprint planning

### BLG-OPS-19 — External API cost attribution per feature
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Operations / Cost Monitoring
**Owner:** Infrastructure & Operations Owner
**Source:** IDEA-ops-20260421-03 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** M (~2 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** BLG-OPS-17 complete (Alpaca cost monitoring instrumented).

**Problem**
External API calls are not attributed to the feature or workflow that triggered them. After BLG-OPS-17 instruments Alpaca, the next step is attributing each API call to the triggering feature (screener run, research view load, trade plan creation). This enables per-feature cost analysis and informs future optimisation decisions.

**Scope**
- Call attribution: tag each outbound API call with the triggering endpoint/feature
- Attribution report: cost breakdown by feature
- Identify top 3 cost contributors

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Each external API call tagged with triggering feature
- Attribution report computable
- Gate condition (BLG-OPS-17 complete) verified before sprint planning

### BLG-OPS-20 — Research endpoint cost monitoring
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Operations / Cost Monitoring
**Owner:** Infrastructure & Operations Owner
**Source:** IDEA-ops-20260421-04 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** PT-02 (Research View) live ≥ 30 days.

**Problem**
Research view loads trigger multiple downstream API calls (Yahoo Finance OHLCV, earnings, news). The per-session API cost of the research endpoint is not tracked. After 30 days of research view usage, a cost-per-session baseline can be established and anomalies detected.

**Scope**
- Instrument research endpoint: log external API calls triggered per request
- Cost-per-session aggregate (weekly baseline)
- Anomaly detection: sessions with >2× baseline API call count

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Research endpoint API call count logged per session
- Weekly baseline computable
- Gate condition verified by Infrastructure & Operations Owner before sprint planning

### BLG-OPS-21 — Arc 2 compute cost review
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Operations / Cost Review
**Owner:** Infrastructure & Operations Owner
**Source:** IDEA-ops-20260421-05 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** PT-04 (Setup Quality Score) shipped AND 30-day cost baseline exists (BLG-OPS-17 or BLG-OPS-18 complete).

**Problem**
Arc 2 adds screener batch processing, research endpoints, and AI-assisted trade plan features. No compute cost review has been conducted since Arc 1. Once Arc 2 is complete and a 30-day cost baseline is available, a targeted review of Arc 2 compute overhead (CPU, memory, external API cost) should be conducted to inform Arc 3 infrastructure decisions.

**Scope**
- Review compute cost across Arc 2 features against Arc 1 baseline
- Identify top 3 cost drivers
- Produce recommendations for Arc 3 infrastructure planning

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Arc 2 vs Arc 1 compute cost comparison produced
- Recommendations filed
- Gate condition verified before sprint planning

### BLG-OPS-23 — Screener performance benchmark
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Operations / Performance Baseline
**Owner:** Infrastructure & Operations Owner
**Source:** IDEA-ops-20260421-07 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** BLG-OPS-13 (performance baseline) complete.

**Problem**
Screener batch runs involve 500+ ticker OHLCV fetches. No formal latency benchmark exists for screener run duration (p50/p95 end-to-end). BLG-OPS-13 establishes the API endpoint baseline; this item extends that to the full screener batch run. Without a benchmark, regressions introduced by new screener features (e.g., quality scoring) cannot be detected.

**Scope**
- Benchmark: full screener run duration (p50/p95) against full ticker universe
- Filed in `docs/ops/api_performance_baseline.md`
- Regression alert threshold: >1.5× baseline duration

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Screener run p50/p95 benchmark measured and filed
- Regression threshold defined
- Gate condition (BLG-OPS-13 complete) verified before sprint planning

### BLG-OPS-24 — Research endpoint performance benchmark
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Operations / Performance Baseline
**Owner:** Infrastructure & Operations Owner
**Source:** IDEA-ops-20260421-08 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** BLG-OPS-13 (performance baseline) complete AND research endpoint shows regression risk (p95 latency trending up over 30d).

**Problem**
BLG-OPS-13 adds research endpoints to the API performance baseline, but ongoing p95 trending is not monitored. If the research endpoint p95 latency trends upward over 30 days (indicating regression from data volume growth or upstream API changes), a targeted benchmark re-run and root cause investigation is warranted.

**Scope**
- Monthly p95 latency tracking for research endpoint
- Trend report: 30d rolling p95 chart
- Root cause investigation trigger at >1.5× baseline

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Monthly p95 tracking implemented
- Trend report computable
- Gate condition (BLG-OPS-13 + regression trend) verified before sprint planning

### BLG-OPS-25 — Automated staging smoke test on CI/CD deploy
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Operations / CI/CD
**Owner:** Director of Quality; Infrastructure & Operations Owner
**Source:** IDEA-director-of-quality-20260522-02 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-22__scheduled (DL-033)
**Effort:** M (~2 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** BLG-OPS-27 (automated staging re-deployment on main merge) complete.

**Problem**
Every delivery verification run begins with manual staging health checks. An automated smoke test triggered by CI/CD on each staging deployment would catch deployment regressions (broken environment, missing env vars, cold-start failures) before the delivery verification engine starts, reducing lag and false-positive manual effort.

**Scope**
- Smoke test suite: 3–5 critical endpoint health checks (backend health, screener availability, positions endpoint)
- Triggered automatically after staging deploy (requires BLG-OPS-27 deploy hook)
- Failure: deploy pipeline reports failure; delivery verification engine advised
- Output: smoke test pass/fail result stored in CI artefacts

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Smoke test suite authored and triggered on staging deploy
- Suite covers minimum 3 critical endpoints
- Failure prevents "staging ready" signal from being issued
- Gate condition (BLG-OPS-27 complete) verified before sprint planning

### BLG-OPS-41 — Red flag events table archiving strategy
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Operations / Data Lifecycle
**Owner:** Infrastructure & Operations Owner
**Source:** IDEA-infra-ops-20260522-02 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-27__scheduled (DL-035, 3-cycle cap)
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** red_flag_events table 6+ months old (post 2026-11-22).

**Problem**
The red_flag_events table has no defined retention or archiving strategy. As override events accumulate, the table will grow. Without an archiving policy, the table may require unplanned manual intervention. Defining the strategy before the table reaches significant size is operationally prudent.

**Scope**
- Define: retention window (e.g., keep 12 months active; archive older rows to cold storage)
- Define: archiving trigger (size-based vs age-based) and procedure
- Document strategy in ops notes; complement BLG-BE-24 retention policy

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Archiving strategy document produced
- Retention window and trigger defined
- Gate condition (table 6+ months old) verified before commencing

### BLG-OPS-48 — ANTHROPIC_API_KEY 6-month scope audit
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Operations / Security
**Owner:** Cybersecurity & Trust Lead; Infrastructure & Operations Owner
**Source:** IDEA-cybersecurity-20260601-02 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-06-01__scheduled (DL-036)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** ~v4.9 (date-gated: no earlier than 2026-11-01)
**Provisional-Target:** Gate date: 2026-11-01 (~6 months after BLG-OPS-36 scope review in v4.2, 2026-05-28)

**Problem**
BLG-OPS-36 (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY scope review) was completed in v4.2 (2026-05-28). Security policy (BLG-OPS-38) requires periodic key scope reviews. 6-month follow-up due ~November 2026 to verify key scope remains minimal and no scope creep has occurred in the API key permissions.

**Scope**
- Review ANTHROPIC_API_KEY permissions against current usage patterns
- Confirm key is not used outside the documented endpoints (generate-thesis, check-daily-cost)
- Verify key rotation has occurred per BLG-OPS-38 policy
- Document review findings

**Acceptance Criteria**
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY scope confirmed minimal (only documented endpoints)
- Key rotation confirmed per BLG-OPS-38 schedule
- Review findings documented

### BLG-SPEC-35 — PO-02 §13 boundary review for AI cross-journal analysis
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Type:** Governance / §13 Compliance
**Owner:** Strategy Rules & System Intent Owner
**Source:** IDEA-strategy-owner-20260522-02 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-22__scheduled (DL-033)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** PO-02 (Journal Pattern Recognition) sprint planning imminent.

**Problem**
PO-02 (Journal Pattern Recognition) will use AI to analyse cross-journal entries for recurring themes, emotional patterns, and setup types. This is an AI-assisted analysis of trading behaviour — the §13 boundary review must confirm this constitutes display/insight only and does not constitute signal generation or automated advisory. §13 PASS is required before PO-02 sprint planning seals.

**Scope**
- Run §13 checklist against PO-02 story set before sprint planning seals
- Confirm AI analysis output is: display-only, human-reviewed, no automated position recommendations
- Document binding conditions (if any) analogous to IT-06 §13 PASS conditions
- Sign-off recorded in sprint planning artefact

**Acceptance Criteria**
- §13 review completed; PASS or FAIL determination documented
- Binding conditions (if any) recorded
- Gate condition verified before PO-02 sprint planning seals

### BLG-SPEC-36 — PO-02 AI output audit schema
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Spec / Governance
**Owner:** AI Compliance & Governance Officer; Head of Specs Team
**Source:** IDEA-ai-compliance-20260522-01 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-22__scheduled (DL-033)
**Effort:** M (~1–2 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** PO-02 (Journal Pattern Recognition) sprint planning imminent.

**Problem**
PO-02 will generate AI output (pattern summaries, theme classifications) using an LLM. Governance policy requires AI-generated content to be traceable to model version, prompt version, and input at time of generation. Designing the audit log schema before sprint planning ensures it is built in from day 1, avoiding retroactive compliance debt.

**Scope**
- Design audit log schema: pattern_id, model_version, prompt_version, journal_ids_included, output_hash, generated_at
- Storage mechanism: append-only table or structured log file
- Retention policy: minimum 90 days
- Schema reviewed by AI Compliance & Governance Officer and Head of Specs Team

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Audit log schema designed and documented
- Storage mechanism defined
- Retention policy specified
- Gate condition verified before sprint planning

### BLG-SPEC-44 — SI-02 drift threshold calibration specification
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Specification / Metrics Definition
**Owner:** Metrics Definitions & Analytics Owner; Head of Specs Team
**Source:** IDEA-metrics-analytics-20260601-01 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-03__scheduled (DL-038; gate cleared: BLG-GOV-87 shipped v5.0)
**Effort:** M (~1–2 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** SI-02 frontend sprint planning triggered; 20+ closed trades confirmed. BLG-GOV-87 re-entry criteria document shipped v5.0 — functional activation gate still pending.

**Problem**
SI-02 backend (shipped v4.6) defines 4 drift metrics (early_entry_rate, momentum_override_rate, losing_streak_sizing, regime_deviation_rate) but does not specify meaningful alert thresholds. Without calibrated thresholds, the frontend display may surface false positives (alert fatigue) or miss genuine drift. Thresholds should be defined before frontend activation.

**Scope**
- Define alert thresholds for each of the 4 drift metrics (e.g., early_entry_rate > 40% = amber, > 60% = red)
- Provide rationale for each threshold (e.g., based on your own historical compliance data, statistical percentiles)
- Define score interpretation guidance for the user-facing display
- Add threshold definitions to metrics_definitions.md (per §12 of that document)

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Threshold calibration specification document produced
- All 4 drift metrics have defined alert levels with rationale
- metrics_definitions.md updated with drift threshold definitions
- Gate condition verified before sprint planning

### BLG-SPEC-46 — Arc 4 API contract pre-planning surface area
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Specification / API Contracts
**Owner:** API Contracts & Documentation Owner; Head of Specs Team
**Source:** IDEA-api-contracts-20260601-01 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-03__scheduled (DL-038)
**Effort:** M (~1–2 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** BLG-SPEC-35 (PO-02 §13 boundary review) complete. Arc 4 API contract surface area is premature before §13 determines whether PO-02/PO-03 constitute "adaptive logic" or "structured pattern extraction."

**Problem**
PO-02 (journal pattern recognition) and PO-03 (behavioural error taxonomy) will each require new API endpoints. Pre-defining the endpoint surface area (GET /analytics/journal-patterns, classification endpoints) before Arc 4 sprint prevents same-sprint API spec debt analogous to the Arc 5 retroactive contracts filed in v4.1/v4.2.

**Scope**
- Define candidate endpoint names and response shapes for PO-02 and PO-03
- Produce lightweight endpoint surface area document (not full contracts — just paths, methods, response envelopes)
- Input to Arc 4 release planning; pre-authorise contract authoring for named endpoints

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Endpoint surface area document produced for PO-02 and PO-03 APIs
- Reviewed by API Contracts & Documentation Owner and Head of Specs Team
- Gate condition (BLG-SPEC-35 complete) verified before commencing

### BLG-SPEC-55 — Arc 4 API contract pre-planning surface area advancement check (gate-conditional)
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Specification / API Contracts
**Owner:** API Contracts & Documentation Owner; Head of Specs Team
**Source:** IDEA-api-contracts-20260607-02 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-09__scheduled (DL-041)
**Effort:** S (~0.5–1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled
**Gate criteria:** PO-02 (Journal Pattern Recognition) sprint planning confirmed imminent — when PO confirms ≥6 months AI-summarised journal entries gate is cleared and PO-02 is entering sprint planning

**Problem**
BLG-SPEC-46 (Arc 4 API surface area) is a gate-conditional spec planning item that was parked until PO-02 sprint planning is imminent (~Oct 2026). When that gate clears, an advancement check should confirm BLG-SPEC-46's scope still reflects the final Arc 4 API surface — the surface may have evolved since BLG-SPEC-46 was authored. This item tracks that confirmation step.

**Scope**
- Review BLG-SPEC-46 against current api_contracts/ documents and openapi.yaml
- Confirm Arc 4 API surface is still accurately captured or produce a revision scope
- Produce brief readiness note: "BLG-SPEC-46 proceed as-is" or list required updates
- Gate: PO-02 sprint planning imminent confirmation by PMO Lead

**Acceptance Criteria**
- BLG-SPEC-46 scope reviewed against current API surface
- Readiness note produced with clear proceed/update decision
- API Contracts & Documentation Owner sign-off
- Gate condition verified

### BLG-GOV-26 — Arc velocity tracking dashboard
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Governance Process
**Owner:** PMO Lead
**Source:** IDEA-governance-20260421-01 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** PT-04 (Setup Quality Score) shipped — Arc 2 velocity history complete.

**Problem**
No arc-level velocity tracking exists. Cycle velocity is tracked per-cycle (cycle_velocity in run_manifest.md), but no aggregate view shows velocity trends across an entire arc. Once Arc 2 is complete (PT-04 shipped), an Arc 2 velocity retrospective would establish baseline expectations for Arc 3 planning.

**Scope**
- Arc velocity report: stories/cycle, epic completion rate, arc-level rolling velocity
- Filed in governance reporting; updated at arc close
- Input to release planning engine for arc-boundary cycles

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Arc 2 velocity report produced at arc close
- Report format reusable for Arc 3+
- Gate condition verified by PMO Lead before sprint planning

**Owner:** PMO Lead; Head of Specs Team
**Source:** IDEA-governance-20260421-02 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** M (~1–2 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** ≥ 3 arcs running concurrently (Arc 3, Arc 4, Arc 5 or later all in active/planned state simultaneously).

**Problem**
Current arcs (Arc 2, Arc 3, Arc 4) have informal dependency tracking (noted in roadmap annotations). If 3 or more arcs are in concurrent active or planned state, cross-arc dependency conflicts become a risk: feature data dependencies, shared backend schema changes, and governance sequencing conflicts all require explicit mapping. Gate ensures effort is only incurred when the complexity warrants it.

**Scope**
- Cross-arc dependency map: for each arc, list upstream arcs (data dependencies) and downstream arcs (consumes output)
- Conflict detection: identify stories across arcs that modify shared resources
- Filed in `claude/strategy/`

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Cross-arc dependency map produced
- Conflicts (if any) documented and escalation plan filed
- Gate condition (≥3 concurrent arcs) verified by PMO Lead before sprint planning

### BLG-GOV-28 — PT-04 §13 compliance review
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Governance Process
**Owner:** Head of Specs Team
**Source:** IDEA-governance-20260421-03 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** PT-04 sprint planning imminent (sprint planning seals within the next cycle).

**Problem**
PT-04 (Setup Quality Score) involves a new backend scoring algorithm and a new API endpoint. §13 compliance review (execution_prompt.md §13 — pre-sprint implementation review checklist) must be completed before PT-04 sprint planning seals, per CLAUDE.md §13 gate rules. This item tracks the gate-conditional §13 review so it is not missed when PT-04 is next scheduled.

**Scope**
- Run §13 checklist against PT-04 story set before sprint planning seals
- Flag any compliance gaps to Head of Specs Team and Product Owner
- Sign-off recorded in sprint planning artefact

**Acceptance Criteria**
- §13 review completed and sign-off recorded
- Gate condition (PT-04 sprint planning imminent) verified before initiating review

### BLG-GOV-29 — Trade plan AI summary audit log
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Governance Process
**Owner:** Head of Specs Team; QA Lead
**Source:** IDEA-governance-20260421-04 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-21__scheduled (DL-032)
**Effort:** M (~1–2 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** AI trade plan analysis feature scoped and scheduled (i.e., a story exists in the backlog that adds AI-generated trade plan summaries or analysis).

**Problem**
If an AI-assisted trade plan analysis feature is scoped (generating text summaries, recommendations, or signals using an LLM), an audit log is required per governance policy (AI-generated content must be traceable to the model version, prompt version, and input at time of generation). Without a pre-designed audit log schema, retrofitting this after feature delivery creates governance debt.

**Scope**
- Audit log schema: plan_id, model_version, prompt_version, input_hash, output_hash, generated_at
- Storage: append-only table or log file
- Retention policy: minimum 90 days

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Audit log schema designed and documented
- Storage mechanism implemented
- Gate condition (AI trade plan analysis feature scoped) verified by Head of Specs Team before sprint planning

### BLG-GOV-68 — Backlog item inter-dependency tracking
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Governance / Process Enhancement
**Owner:** PMO Lead; Head of Specs Team
**Source:** IDEA-pmo-lead-20260522-01 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-05-27__scheduled (DL-035, 3-cycle cap)
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** 20+ concurrent implementation items in a single sprint causing dependency-blocking.

**Problem**
Backlog items have no explicit Blocks/Blocked-by fields. Cross-item dependencies are currently documented via prose in backlog entries (e.g. "Gate: BLG-OPS-36 complete"). As the backlog grows, undiscovered dependencies become sprint-time blockers. A formal inter-dependency field would surface critical path items at sprint planning.

**Scope**
- Add Blocks/Blocked-by field to backlog item format (optional; populated when dependency is known)
- Update sprint planning engine to surface Blocks/Blocked-by chains
- Back-fill critical known dependencies (BLG-OPS-36 → BLG-OPS-37, etc.)

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Field format defined and documented in backlog header conventions
- Sprint planning engine updated to surface dependency chains
- Gate condition (20+ concurrent items with dependency-blocking evidence) verified before commencing

### BLG-GOV-71 — Governance engine complexity assessment (gate-conditional)
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Governance / Process
**Owner:** Director of HR; PMO Lead
**Source:** IDEA-director-of-hr-20260525-02 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-06-01__scheduled (DL-036; terminal 3-cycle disposition)
**Effort:** M (~2–3 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** Audit overall score drops below 70 OR a step-skip event is formally documented in an audit report.

**Problem**
Governance engine prompts have grown complex over 33 cycles. Without periodic complexity assessment, latent process friction accumulates invisibly. This assessment would identify steps that rarely trigger, candidates for simplification, and produce a governance simplification roadmap for meta-review.

**Scope**
- For each governance engine prompt: count steps, hard gates, and write operations
- Identify steps with documented "never triggered" patterns from lessons_learnt.md history
- Propose candidates for simplification, consolidation, or removal

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Per-engine complexity metrics documented
- Simplification candidates enumerated with rationale
- Gate condition verified before commencing

### BLG-GOV-73 — Scheduled rebalance cadence review
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Governance / Process
**Owner:** PMO Lead; Head of Specs Team
**Source:** IDEA-pmo-lead-20260601-02 + IDEA-challenger-20260601-02 (merged) — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-06-01__scheduled (DL-036)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** Advance at next meta-review cycle (rebalance_cycles_since_meta_review ≥ 3).

**Problem**
10+ scheduled rebalances since 2026-03-24. CPS stable at 1.15. Multiple consecutive scheduled rebalances have had empty Now horizons with no items advancing. The Challenger raised the concern that running full governance process when no strategic decision is pending may produce overhead without proportional value.

**Scope**
- Review scheduled rebalances since last meta-review for value produced (items advanced, horizon movements, CPS changes)
- Assess whether a lightweight mode for no-change-expected cycles could reduce overhead
- Produce recommendation: maintain cadence or propose modification; present at next meta-review

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Value analysis of recent scheduled rebalances documented
- Recommendation produced and presented at next meta-review
- Gate condition (cycles_since_meta_review ≥ 3) verified before commencing

**Type:** Governance / Compliance
**Owner:** AI Compliance & Governance Officer; PMO Lead
**Source:** IDEA-ai-compliance-20260601-02 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-06-01__scheduled (DL-036; fulfills BLG-GOV-63 mandate)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** v4.10 or first cycle after 2026-08-29
**Gate date:** First review due 2026-08-29 (3 months after v4.0 AI feature ship 2026-05-29)

**Problem**
BLG-GOV-63 (shipped v4.2) requires a quarterly review of the claude_audit_log. First quarterly review due 2026-08-29. Without a backlog item it will be missed.

**Scope**
- Review claude_audit_log for the preceding quarter (v4.0–v4.8 window)
- Assess: total thesis generation requests, model version used, override_rate, cost per use
- Flag anomalies; document findings; file BLG items for any anomalies

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Quarterly audit log review completed; findings documented
- Anomalies (if any) filed as BLG items
- Next review date recorded (2026-11-29)

### BLG-OPS-51 — Add GET /analytics/strategy-version-comparison to api_performance_baseline.md (when implemented)
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Operations / Performance Baseline
**Owner:** Infrastructure & Operations Owner; API Contracts & Documentation Owner
**Source:** Post-ship closure 2026-06-01__release-v4.8 — endpoint coverage drift advisory (STEP 6)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** SI-04 sprint (whenever GET /analytics/strategy-version-comparison is implemented)

**Problem**
v4.8 ST-07 added a placeholder entry for GET /analytics/strategy-version-comparison to openapi.yaml (pre-authored contract; not yet implemented). Once implemented, this endpoint will need p50/p95 latency measurement and an entry in docs/ops/api_performance_baseline.md.

**Scope**
- After SI-04 sprint implements the endpoint: run performance baseline measurement (p50/p95)
- Add measurement to docs/ops/api_performance_baseline.md

**Acceptance Criteria**
- GET /analytics/strategy-version-comparison present in api_performance_baseline.md with p50/p95 values
- Measurement conducted with ≥5 staging samples

### BLG-OPS-53 — Application log retention policy expansion (Supabase + claude_audit_log)
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Operations / Data Lifecycle
**Owner:** Infrastructure & Operations Owner; Head of Engineering
**Source:** IDEA-infra-ops-20260601-02 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-03__scheduled (DL-038)
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** claude_audit_log table 6+ months old (~Nov 2026, since v4.0 ship 2026-05-22). BLG-OPS-31 (Render log retention policy) shipped v4.7; this extends scope to Supabase query logs and claude_audit_log.

**Problem**
BLG-OPS-31 defined Render log retention. claude_audit_log (shipped v4.0) and Supabase query logs have no defined retention policy. As audit log volume grows, query performance and storage cost may degrade without archiving strategy.

**Scope**
- Define retention period for claude_audit_log (e.g., 12 months rolling)
- Define Supabase query log retention consistent with data privacy obligations
- Define archiving trigger (log volume threshold or time-based)
- Document policy in docs/operations/

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Retention policy document produced covering claude_audit_log and Supabase query logs
- Archiving cadence defined
- Gate condition (6+ months of audit log data) verified before sprint planning

### BLG-OPS-54 — Add POST /digest/si05/send to api_performance_baseline.md
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Operations / Performance Baseline
**Owner:** Infrastructure & Operations Owner; PMO Lead
**Source:** Post-ship closure 2026-06-21__release-v5.1 — endpoint drift check (STEP 6)
**Effort:** XS (~1–2 hours)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled (pending live environment access)
**Scope revision (I&O Owner, 2026-06-22):** Standard external HTTP measurement is not viable for this endpoint — it blocks on the Telegram Bot API and timed out at 45s in the §19 baseline run. Revised approach: (1) Render internal log duration (server-side p50/p95), (2) weekly delivery success rate from `si05_digest_log`, (3) Telegram API timeout flag if request duration > 30s. See ST-11 staging evidence (docs/testing/staging_latency_review_ST-11.md).

**Problem**
`POST /digest/si05/send` was added to `docs/reference/openapi.yaml` in v5.1 (ST-01, EPIC-01). This endpoint is not present in `docs/ops/api_performance_baseline.md`. Standard external HTTP measurement is not viable (Telegram API timeout — excluded from §19 standard run). A Render internal log-based measurement approach is required.

**Scope**
- Add `POST /digest/si05/send` to `docs/ops/api_performance_baseline.md` using Render internal log duration (server-side), not external HTTP timing
- Extract p50/p95 from Render production logs for the dispatch endpoint
- Record weekly delivery success rate from `si05_digest_log` as the primary health metric

**Acceptance Criteria**
- POST /digest/si05/send present in api_performance_baseline.md with Render internal log-based measurements recorded
- Measurement methodology note added explaining why standard external HTTP timing does not apply

### BLG-GOV-84 — Arc 6 gate revision and threshold assessment
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Governance / Product Planning
**Owner:** Product Owner; Challenger; Strategy Rules & System Intent Owner
**Source:** IDEA-product-owner-20260527-02 + IDEA-challenger-20260527-01 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-06-02__scheduled (DL-037; terminal Parked-cycle-2 combined disposition)
**Effort:** M (~1–2 days)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** ≥ 50 closed trades (trajectory approaching) — at current ~1–2 trades/month, this is approximately 2026-Q4/2027.

**Problem**
PS-01 (Edge Analysis Dashboard) gate requires 100+ trades with plans and lifecycle data. At current trade frequency (1–2 trades/month), this gate takes 5–8 years to clear. The Challenger has raised (twice) that a meaningful edge analysis may be achievable with 20–30 closed trades with explicit statistical caveats. The Product Owner's Arc 6 minimum viable entry assessment (also raised twice) asks whether the gate calibration is appropriate. Both ideas address the same question: is the 100-trade threshold right? A formal assessment when trade count approaches 50 is the appropriate trigger.

**Scope**
- Formal assessment: at ≥50 closed trades, evaluate whether PS-01 can yield meaningful signal with available history (20–30 qualifying trades as a subset)
- Assess: what statistical confidence is achievable at 30 vs 50 vs 100 trades? Are explicit caveats sufficient to communicate limited confidence?
- Challenge the threshold: if PO decides 30–50 trades is sufficient with caveats, recommend gate revision; document decision in decision_log.md
- §13 check: any gate revision must remain within the "deterministic historical analysis" framework; no predictive claims

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Assessment document produced when ≥50 closed trades confirmed
- Threshold recommendation made (maintain 100-trade gate OR revise with documented caveats)
- PO + Challenger + Strategy Rules Owner sign-off on recommendation
- If gate revised: decision_log.md updated; PS-01 roadmap section updated
- Gate condition (≥50 closed trades approaching) verified before commencing

### BLG-GOV-85 — Arc 6 §13 pre-assessment boundary document
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Governance / §13 Compliance Pre-work
**Owner:** Strategy Rules & System Intent Owner
**Source:** IDEA-strategy-owner-20260527-02 — Promoted-Backlog cycle 2026-06-02__scheduled (DL-037; terminal Parked-cycle-2 disposition)
**Effort:** S (~0.5–1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** Arc 6 release planning trigger (first sprint planning cycle that includes a PS-01 through PS-05 story).

**Problem**
Arc 6 features (PS-01 through PS-05) are roadmapped with informal §13 compliance notes ("deterministic simulation, §13 COMPLIANT"; "statistical observation, not prediction"). Before Arc 6 sprint planning seals, a formal §13 pre-assessment must consolidate binding conditions for each feature — as was done for SI-01 (8 conditions), IT-06 (4 conditions), SI-04 (6 conditions). PS-03 already has a formal §13 PASS assessment (10 conditions, v4.6). PS-01, PS-02, PS-04, PS-05 need similar pre-assessment documents.

**Scope**
- Formal §13 pre-assessment for PS-01, PS-02, PS-04, PS-05 (PS-03 already complete)
- Each assessment confirms: deterministic calculation only, display-only output, no automated recommendations, no ML/prediction components
- Binding conditions documented per the SI-01/IT-06 pattern
- Strategy Rules & System Intent Owner sign-off required on each assessment

**Acceptance Criteria**
- §13 assessment documents produced for PS-01, PS-02, PS-04, PS-05
- Binding conditions documented for each PASS determination
- Gate condition (Arc 6 release planning trigger) verified before commencing

### BLG-GOV-90 — Claude model deprecation monitoring procedure
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Governance / AI Compliance
**Owner:** AI Compliance & Governance Officer; Infrastructure & Operations Owner
**Source:** IDEA-ai-compliance-20260601-01 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-03__scheduled (DL-038)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** BLG-GOV-74 first quarterly AI feature review completes (due 2026-08-29). Consolidate this procedure definition with the BLG-GOV-74 review action.

**Problem**
BLG-GOV-64 pins the model to claude-3-5-sonnet. Anthropic publishes model deprecation notices. No formal procedure exists for checking deprecation notices on a schedule and triggering a governed sprint story to update the pinned model. BLG-GOV-74 (quarterly AI review, first due 2026-08-29) is the natural integration point for a standard procedure.

**Scope**
- Define quarterly deprecation check procedure: check Anthropic model lifecycle page, compare against pinned model in BLG-GOV-64 policy
- Define trigger: if deprecation notice issued → file P1 sprint story to update pinned model
- Document procedure in docs/governance/ai_model_policy.md or equivalent

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Deprecation monitoring procedure defined and documented
- Procedure integrated with BLG-GOV-74 quarterly review cadence
- Gate condition (BLG-GOV-74 first review complete) verified before sprint planning

### BLG-GOV-91 — SI-04 strategy history access security review
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Governance / Security Review
**Owner:** Cybersecurity & Trust Lead; Strategy Rules & System Intent Owner
**Source:** IDEA-cybersecurity-20260601-01 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-03__scheduled (DL-038; gate cleared: BLG-GOV-88 shipped v5.0)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Gate criteria:** SI-04 sprint planning imminent. BLG-GOV-88 (binding conditions doc) shipped v5.0 — SI-04 remains in Later horizon; gate triggers when SI-04 enters sprint planning.

**Problem**
SI-04 (strategy version comparison) will access historical strategy_rules.md content and link it to trade data. This creates a data access pattern not present in SI-01 through SI-03: querying historical document versions alongside personal trade records. A security pre-assessment confirms whether this pattern introduces any data pattern or access control concerns before sprint planning.

**Scope**
- Assess data access pattern: historical strategy content + trade data linkage
- Determine if any additional access controls or audit logging are required
- Document as security review record per BLG-GOV-31 (security review pattern)
- Cybersecurity & Trust Lead sign-off

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Security review record produced covering SI-04 data access pattern
- PASS or REQUIRES_MITIGATIONS determination with evidence
- Cybersecurity & Trust Lead sign-off recorded
- Gate condition verified before sprint planning

**Source:** IDEA-strategy-owner-20260607-02 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-07__scheduled (DL-039)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled
**Displacement:** BLG-GOV-29 (trade plan AI audit log, P3, gate-conditional) deprioritised.

**Gate criteria:** ≥ 30 closed trades with ATR-based stop exits in production (sufficient data density to assess parameter appropriateness).

**Problem**
strategy_rules.md §11 defines production parameters (5× initial ATR, 2× profitable ATR, 10-day grace period). These have never been reviewed against live trading performance data — the system has run on its original parameter settings since inception. §12.3 requires documented rationale for any parameter change, but there is no scheduled review mechanism to surface whether changes are warranted.

**Scope**
- Define annual parameter review process: PMO Lead adds review to the next roadmap rebalance after gate clears (≥30 closed trades with stop exits)
- Review scope: compare actual trade outcomes against parameter-predicted outcomes for each parameter (does 5× ATR give sufficient breathing room? does 2× ATR lock in enough gain on average?)
- Output: parameter review report; PO + Strategy Rules owner decision: maintain, adjust (with §12.3 rationale), or schedule future review
- If parameters adjusted: follow §12.3 change control (version increment, rationale, consistency across backtests)

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Parameter review process document produced
- Gate condition (≥30 closed trades with stops) verified before review commences
- Product Owner and Strategy Rules & System Intent Owner sign-off on review findings
- If parameters adjusted: strategy_rules.md version increment with §12.3-compliant rationale

### BLG-GOV-102 — Arc completion velocity scorecard (gate-conditional)
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Governance / Product Planning Reference
**Owner:** Product Owner; PMO Lead
**Source:** IDEA-product-owner-20260607-02 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-07__scheduled (DL-039)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled
**Displacement:** BLG-GOV-85 (Arc 6 §13 boundary document, P3, gate-conditional) deprioritised.

**Gate criteria:** Arc 5 fully complete (all five Arc 5 features: SI-01 ✅, SI-03 ✅, SI-05 Phase 1 ✅, SI-02 frontend, SI-04 — all shipped).

**Problem**
With 6 arcs spanning v2.9–v4.0+, there is no single reference document showing arc-level completion status: which arcs are done, which are in progress, which features remain, and what gate conditions are outstanding. As the project moves from Arc 5 toward Arc 6, assembling this picture from multiple sections of current_roadmap.md is time-consuming at each release planning session.

**Scope**
- One-page arc completion scorecard: for each of the 6 arcs, list (a) arc status (Complete/In Progress/Planned), (b) features shipped, (c) features remaining, (d) gate conditions outstanding, (e) earliest realistic activation date
- Filed in docs/product/ or claude/roadmap/
- Updated at each major arc milestone; not a living document requiring cycle-by-cycle updates

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Arc completion scorecard document produced covering all 6 arcs
- Gate condition (Arc 5 fully complete) verified before authoring (ensures Arc 5 data is final)
- Product Owner sign-off

**Owner:** Director of Quality; PMO Lead
**Source:** IDEA-pmo-lead-20260607-01 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-07__scheduled (DL-039)
**Effort:** XS (~1 hour)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled
**Displacement:** BLG-GOV-90 (Claude model deprecation monitoring procedure, P2, gate-conditional) deprioritised.

**Gate criteria:** BLG-GOV-89 (staged verification sprint protocol, shipped v5.1) used 2+ times in practice. First use: v5.1 staged ACs; second use: this staged verification sprint (SI-05 Phase 1 deferred ACs). Gate clears after the v5.1 staged verification sprint is completed.

**Problem**
BLG-GOV-89 (staged verification sprint protocol) defines the pattern. After 2+ uses, a companion tracking worksheet — a simple checklist capturing: which releases have deferred ACs, which ACs per release, their status (pending/verified/signed-off) — would reduce coordination overhead when multiple staged ACs accumulate across releases.

**Scope**
- Produce a single-page tracking worksheet template (Markdown table) for staged verification sprints: columns = Release, AC ID, Description, Status, Evidence, Sign-off Date
- Template filed in docs/operations/ alongside BLG-GOV-89 protocol
- Reviewed by Director of Quality and PMO Lead

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Worksheet template produced and filed
- Gate condition (BLG-GOV-89 used 2+ times) verified before authoring
- Director of Quality and PMO Lead sign-off

### BLG-GOV-105 — Arc 6 PS-03 Monte Carlo §13 threshold pre-assessment
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Governance / §13 Compliance
**Owner:** Strategy Rules & System Intent Owner
**Source:** IDEA-strategy-owner-20260608-02 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-08__scheduled (DL-040)
**Effort:** S (~0.5–1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled (before Arc 6 moves from Later to Next)
**Displacement:** BLG-GOV-111 (v5.3 design gate pre-assessment, lower-P) deprioritised.

**Problem**
Arc 6 PS-03 (Monte Carlo simulation) requires a §13 review before sprint planning. The core §13 question — "is Monte Carlo simulation deterministic or predictive?" — can be answered definitively now without knowing implementation details. A pre-assessment scoped to this threshold question de-risks Arc 6 sprint planning entry.

**Scope**
- Assess whether Monte Carlo simulation as described in current_roadmap.md §5 (PS-03 notes) is deterministic (replaying own trade distribution) or predictive (forecasting future outcomes)
- Determine: does PS-03 engage the §13 boundary "Not an ML-based prediction system"?
- Produce a one-page §13 threshold assessment; if PASS (deterministic), note that binding conditions will be defined at full §13 review when Arc 6 moves to Next
- Note: scope is threshold question only — NOT a full §13 review with binding conditions

**Acceptance Criteria**
- §13 threshold assessment produced for PS-03 (deterministic vs predictive question answered)
- PASS/FAIL on the threshold question documented
- Strategy Rules & System Intent Owner sign-off

### BLG-GOV-119 — Arc 5 delivered value retrospective (gate-conditional)
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Governance / Strategic Review
**Owner:** Product Owner; Strategy Rules & System Intent Owner
**Source:** IDEA-challenger-20260610-01 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-10__scheduled (DL-044)
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled
**Gate criteria:** SI-04 (strategy version comparison) AND SI-05 Phase 2 both shipped

**Problem**
Arc 5 is functionally near-complete (SI-01/02/03 shipped; SI-04 pre-planned; SI-05 Phase 1 live). Before committing to Arc 6, a retrospective against the original Arc 5 end-state intent would confirm whether the arc is delivering its stated purpose: "making every deviation visible, deliberate, and recorded."

**Scope**
- Review Arc 5 end-state description against delivered features
- Assess whether SI-01/02/03/05 collectively achieve the stated purpose
- Produce a 1-page retrospective document; note gaps or intent drift

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Retrospective document produced and filed
- Gap list (if any) filed as backlog items
- Product Owner + Strategy Rules & System Intent Owner sign-off
- Gate: SI-04 + SI-05 Phase 2 both shipped

### BLG-GOV-121 — SI-05 Phase 2 §13 pre-clearance document (gate-conditional)
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Governance / Strategy Compliance
**Owner:** Strategy Rules & System Intent Owner; Product Owner
**Source:** IDEA-strategy-owner-20260610-02 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-10__scheduled (DL-044)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled
**Gate criteria:** 2026-07-04 SI-05 effectiveness review output (BLG-GOV-113) complete AND Phase 2 activation decision made

**Problem**
SI-05 Phase 2 integrates drift signals (SI-02) with the Telegram digest. Before Phase 2 activates, a targeted §13 review should confirm that incorporating drift signals into an automated notification remains compliant with the "not an automated trading system" and "human-in-the-loop" principles. Phase 1 cleared §13 (notification of compliance scores + red flags). Phase 2 adds drift-signal interpretation — this boundary warrants formal pre-clearance.

**Scope**
- Extend the SI-05 Phase 1 §13 review framework to Phase 2 scope
- Confirm: drift signal summary in digest is informational, not prescriptive; no automated action triggered
- Document binding conditions for Phase 2 operation (analogous to IT-06 §13 conditions)

**Acceptance Criteria**
- §13 pre-clearance document produced and filed
- Strategy Rules & System Intent Owner sign-off
- Gate condition verified before Phase 2 sprint planning

**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled

**Problem**
strategy_rules.md §11 defines concrete trading parameters (ATR multipliers, grace period days, regime gate thresholds). These were validated at v5.3 (BLG-GOV-104) but an annual review should confirm they still reflect the operator's current strategy intent. With 40+ cycles and real trading data accumulating, parameter drift (operating differently from what §11 states) should be checked.

**Scope**
- Review §11 parameters against actual trading behaviour over the last 12 months
- Identify any divergence between documented parameters and actual practice
- If divergence found: either update strategy_rules.md (version increment) or document intentional deviation

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Review conducted; findings documented
- If changes: strategy_rules.md versioned and change rationale filed
- Strategy Rules & System Intent Owner sign-off

### BLG-GOV-123 — SC-01: Extract Playwright test standard from execution_prompt.md to shared_standards
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Governance / Prompt Simplification
**Owner:** Head of Specs Team
**Source:** GCA-2026-06-17 — ST-04 (BLG-GOV-101) simplification candidate SC-01
**Effort:** XS (~1 hour)
**Provisional-Target:** v5.9

**Scope**
Section 14 of `execution_prompt.md` defines Playwright test authoring standards (waitFor patterns, mock payload advisory, ~30 lines). This content is loaded on every invocation of the execution engine regardless of whether the sprint contains any Playwright work. Extract to `shared_standards.md §16` (or a new §17) and replace Section 14 with a single reference line. No logic change — structural refactoring only.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Section 14 content moved to shared_standards.md with a new heading
- execution_prompt.md Section 14 replaced with reference: "Playwright test standard: per shared_standards.md §X"
- Version bump on both files; changelog entries appended
- Head of Specs Team sign-off

### BLG-GOV-124 — SC-02: Remove RESUME PRECHECK mutation detection block from release_planning_prompt.md
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Governance / Prompt Simplification
**Owner:** Head of Specs Team
**Source:** GCA-2026-06-17 — ST-04 (BLG-GOV-101) simplification candidate SC-02
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled (governance sprint)

**Scope**
The RESUME PRECHECK mutation detection block in `release_planning_prompt.md` (~80 lines, lines 417–510) handles interrupted multi-session runs and assumption invalidation. This path has never been exercised in 100% of recorded v4.x–v5.x cycles. The lightweight state.json resume rule (7 lines) provides sufficient resumability for the observed failure mode. Remove the invalidation map and efficiency policy block; retain the state.json check. Requires dry-run validation pass.

**Implementation constraint (Head of Specs Team sign-off GCA-2026-06-17):** The Terminal State Guard ("Published Is Immutable") and State File Immutability Rule hard gates within the RESUME PRECHECK block must be extracted and retained outside the block before the mutation detection/invalidation map machinery is removed. The implementing story must explicitly scope the deletion and confirm these two gates survive.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- RESUME PRECHECK mutation detection/invalidation map block removed (mutation-detection portion only)
- Terminal State Guard and State File Immutability Rule hard gates extracted and retained in the prompt body
- State.json resume rule retained
- Dry-run validation pass confirming no functional regression
- Version bump + changelog entry
- Head of Specs Team sign-off

### BLG-FE-72 — Arc 4 PO-02 journal pattern UX spec (gate-conditional)
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Frontend & UX / Specification
**Owner:** Frontend Specs & UX Documentation Owner; Head of UX & Design
**Source:** IDEA-frontend-ux-20260608-02 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-10__scheduled (DL-043)
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled
**Gate criteria:** PO-02 (Journal Pattern Recognition) sprint planning confirmed imminent — PMO Lead confirmation required before commissioning this work

**Problem**
PO-02 (Journal Pattern Recognition) requires displaying cross-entry AI analysis results: recurring themes, emotional patterns, setup types, conditions present at winning vs losing entries. No UX specification exists for how this data should be presented. Before PO-02 enters sprint planning (gate: 6+ months AI journals, ~Oct 2026), a UX spec should be prepared to enable accurate scope definition at sprint planning.

**Scope**
- Define the display patterns for journal theme analysis (list view? heatmap? timeline?)
- Specify how patterns are surfaced: by entry count, by theme frequency, by outcome correlation
- Define empty state and gate-not-met state (< 6 months of journals)
- Produce a canonical frontend spec for the Journal Pattern Recognition UI component

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Frontend spec document produced: data display patterns, empty states, component architecture
- Spec reviewed and signed off by Head of UX & Design and Frontend Specs & UX Documentation Owner
- Gate: PMO Lead confirms PO-02 sprint planning is imminent before this story begins

### BLG-OPS-61 — BLG-OPS-13 v5.1–v5.4 endpoint baseline extension
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Operations / Performance Baseline
**Owner:** Infrastructure & Operations Owner
**Source:** IDEA-infra-ops-20260610-01 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-10__scheduled (DL-044)
**Effort:** S (~0.5–1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** v5.5

**Problem**
BLG-OPS-60 (completed v5.4) added v5.3 endpoints to api_performance_baseline.md. However, v5.1 and v5.2 endpoints (POST /digest/si05/send, GET /portfolio/paper-positions enhancements, new v5.2 routes from BLG-SPEC-49–52) were not included. BLG-OPS-13 targets v2.8–v4.6 endpoints; BLG-OPS-61 closes the v5.1–v5.4 gap.

**Scope**
- Identify all new routes added in v5.1 and v5.2 not yet in api_performance_baseline.md
- Run p50/p95 latency measurements against staging
- Add entries to api_performance_baseline.md

**Acceptance Criteria**
- All v5.1/v5.2 new endpoints have latency entries in the baseline document
- Consistent with existing measurement methodology
- Infrastructure & Operations Owner sign-off

### BLG-OPS-71 — System threat model document
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Operations / Security
**Owner:** Cybersecurity & Trust Lead; Infrastructure & Operations Owner
**Source:** IDEA-cybersecurity-20260304-01 (rejected_but_strong.md) — revival triggered by strategic review 2026-06-18; original rejection condition (no production-scale external exposure) no longer holds; system now handles real position data, stop levels, P&L, Alpaca API credentials, Anthropic/Gemini billing keys, and Telegram bot tokens across staging + production
**Effort:** S (~1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** v6.0

**Problem**
No formal threat model exists. The system handles high-sensitivity financial data (positions, stop levels, P&L) and multiple third-party API credentials with billing exposure (Alpaca, Anthropic, Gemini, Telegram). Current security controls (API key auth on endpoints, CSP, CI secret scanning) were added reactively. A formal threat model identifies attack surfaces and data sensitivity levels in one place — producing a prioritised gap list before an incident forces it.

**Scope**
- Identify attack surfaces: endpoint auth coverage, Supabase access controls, Render environment variable exposure, Telegram webhook, Alpaca paper trading credentials, AI API keys
- Data sensitivity classification: position data (HIGH), stop levels (HIGH), P&L (HIGH), API keys (CRITICAL), user preferences (MEDIUM)
- Threat actors: external web attacker, compromised dependency, accidental exposure
- Document existing mitigations already in place (API key auth, CSP, CI secret scanning gate)
- Identify gaps; file a BLG-OPS or BLG-SPEC item for each gap discovered
- Output: `docs/security/threat_model.md`

**Acceptance Criteria**
- `docs/security/threat_model.md` produced covering all attack surfaces, data classifications, threat actors, current mitigations, and identified gaps
- Any gaps produce separate BLG items before sign-off
- Reviewed and signed off by Cybersecurity & Trust Lead and Infrastructure & Operations Owner

### BLG-SPEC-56 — Arc 4 API contract pre-authoring (PO-02/03/04)
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Spec / Pre-authoring
**Owner:** Head of Specs Team
**Source:** IDEA-head-of-specs-20260619-01 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-19__scheduled (DL-049)
**Effort:** S (~0.5–1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled (pre-work before PO-02 gate ~2026-10)

**Problem**
PO-02 (journal pattern recognition), PO-03 (behavioural error taxonomy), and PO-04 (reflection/outcome correlation) are currently gate-blocked (~2026-10). However, the API contract surface for these features can be pre-authored now, reducing execution risk and spec bottlenecks when the gate clears. Pre-authoring allows the Specs team to identify ambiguities, surface §13 questions, and establish endpoint naming conventions before sprint planning pressure exists.

**Scope**
- Draft API contract stub files for PO-02, PO-03, PO-04 feature endpoints in `docs/specs/api_contracts/`
- Flag any §13 boundary questions for BLG-SPEC-35 (§13 pre-assessment, P1, active)
- No implementation; contract stubs only

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Stub contract files exist for PO-02, PO-03, PO-04 endpoint groups in `docs/specs/api_contracts/`
- Each stub includes at minimum: endpoint path, HTTP method, brief description, key request/response fields
- BLG-SPEC-35 §13 pre-assessment reviewed or updated if new boundary questions arise

### BLG-SPEC-57 — Data model v3 pre-definition for Arc 4 journal intelligence
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Spec / Pre-authoring
**Owner:** Head of Specs Team
**Source:** IDEA-head-of-specs-20260619-02 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-19__scheduled (DL-049)
**Effort:** S (~0.5–1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled (pre-work before PO-02 gate ~2026-10)

**Problem**
Arc 4 journal intelligence (PO-02/03/04) will require data model changes. Pre-defining the schema additions now (while the architecture is in working memory post-Arc 3 delivery) reduces execution risk and produces a migration plan that can be reviewed before sprint planning pressure exists.

**Scope**
- Define data model additions for PO-02/03/04 features (new tables or columns for pattern recognition, error taxonomy, outcome correlation)
- Document as a pre-definition document in `docs/specs/` or `docs/data_models/`
- No migration SQL; schema design only

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Data model pre-definition document produced covering Arc 4 schema additions
- BLG-SPEC-56 Arc 4 API contracts reference the pre-defined model where applicable
- Reviewed by Head of Specs Team and Infrastructure & Operations Owner

### BLG-QA-59 — Arc 4 E2E test strategy pre-design (PO-02/03/04)
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Quality Assurance / Pre-design
**Owner:** Director of Quality
**Source:** IDEA-director-of-quality-20260619-01 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-19__scheduled (DL-049)
**Effort:** S (~0.5–1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled (pre-work before PO-02 gate ~2026-10)

**Problem**
Arc 4 AI-driven features (PO-02/03/04) introduce Playwright test challenges not present in current arcs: AI response non-determinism, journal pattern recognition latency, cost implications of running AI calls in CI. Pre-designing the test strategy before sprint planning avoids last-minute patching of the CI pipeline during delivery.

**Scope**
- Define Playwright test strategy for Arc 4 features: which ACs require Playwright vs unit tests vs staging-only verification
- Define mocking approach for AI API calls in CI (extend existing mock harness)
- Document in `docs/specs/qa/` or `docs/operations/`

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Arc 4 E2E test strategy document produced
- Mocking approach for PO-02/03/04 AI calls defined and consistent with existing BLG-QA-37 Playwright mock strategy
- Reviewed by Director of Quality

### BLG-QA-60 — Register morning-briefing.spec.js and screener-quality.spec.js in playwright.yml CI workflow
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** QA / Test Automation
**Owner:** Director of Quality; Head of Engineering
**Source:** EPIC-04 sprint execution 2026-06-22 — Playwright E2E gate failure on PR #822 revealed EPIC-02 ST-02 and EPIC-03 ST-04 spec files not registered in CI
**Effort:** XS (<1 hour)
**Provisional-Target:** v6.1

**Problem**
`morning-briefing.spec.js` (11 scenarios, EPIC-02 ST-02 AC-09) and `screener-quality.spec.js` (5 scenarios, EPIC-03 ST-04 AC-07) were authored and committed but never added to the explicit test list in `.github/workflows/playwright.yml`. As a result, regressions in the Screener quality panel (SC-SCR-DEG-01) only surfaced at the EPIC-04 merge gate rather than when EPIC-03 landed. Both spec files cover observable ACs that the frontend testing gate requires to be in CI.

**Scope**
- Add `tests/e2e/morning-briefing.spec.js` to the `npx playwright test` command in `playwright.yml`
- Add `tests/e2e/screener-quality.spec.js` to the same command
- Update the spec inventory comment block in `playwright.yml` to list both new files
- Confirm both specs pass in CI before closing

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Both spec files appear in the `playwright.yml` `Run all E2E acceptance tests` step
- CI `Playwright E2E Acceptance Tests` job passes with the new specs included
- Spec inventory comment in `playwright.yml` updated to reflect 25 total spec files

### BLG-QA-61 — Review signals_scenarios.md against ST-01 signal sizing model changes
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** QA / Test Coverage
**Owner:** QA & Testing Owner; Director of Quality
**Source:** v6.0 delivery verification (TSG-v60-01) — signals_scenarios.md listed in execution_state.json test_scenarios for EPIC-01 but not referenced as run in QA evidence; ST-01 removed cash-allocation model and replaced with risk-based sizing
**Effort:** XS (<1 hour)
**Provisional-Target:** v6.1 (before next sprint touching signal generation)

**Problem**
`docs/testing/signals_scenarios.md` documents broader signal domain scenarios. ST-01 (v6.0) removed the cash-allocation model for `suggested_shares` and replaced it with `size_position()` per strategy_rules.md §4.1. Any scenario in `signals_scenarios.md` that asserts a specific `suggested_shares` value based on the old cash-allocation formula (cash / n_signals) will now produce incorrect expected values. These scenarios were not run in v6.0 QA — `tests/test_signal_sizing.py` (new) covered the story-specific ACs, but broader domain regression via `signals_scenarios.md` was not confirmed.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- QA & Testing Owner reviews each scenario in `docs/testing/signals_scenarios.md` that references `suggested_shares`
- Any scenario with stale cash-allocation-based expected values is updated to reflect the risk-based formula output
- Confirmed "no changes needed" or updated scenarios committed before next sprint touching signal generation
- Review outcome noted in next sprint's QA evidence or as a backlog closure note

### BLG-OPS-72 — AI API cost model for Arc 4 journal intelligence features
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Operations / FinOps
**Owner:** FinOps & Resource Architect; Infrastructure & Operations Owner
**Source:** IDEA-finops-20260619-01 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-19__scheduled (DL-049)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled (before Arc 4 sprint planning)

**Problem**
PO-02 (journal pattern recognition) and PO-03/04 will call the Anthropic or Gemini API for AI summarisation and pattern analysis. Current AI cost modelling (BLG-OPS-65, completed v5.6) covers the thesis generation feature only. Arc 4 AI features will process trade journal entries in volume — potentially 1 AI call per journal entry per user per week. Without a cost model, Arc 4 budget impact is unknown and could exceed the current $0.05–$0.15/month baseline significantly.

**Scope**
- Estimate API call volume for PO-02/03/04 features based on expected usage patterns
- Model monthly cost at current Anthropic/Gemini pricing tiers
- Identify cost controls (caching, batching, user limits) and their estimated savings
- Document as `docs/operations/arc4_ai_cost_model.md`

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Cost model document produced with estimated monthly AI API cost for Arc 4 features
- Cost controls identified and quantified
- Reviewed by FinOps & Resource Architect

### BLG-OPS-73 — Add PATCH /trades/{trade_id}/costs to api_performance_baseline.md
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Operations / Performance Baseline
**Owner:** Infrastructure & Operations Owner

**Effort:** XS (<1 hour)
**Provisional-Target:** v6.1

**Problem**
`PATCH /trades/{trade_id}/costs` was added in v6.0 (ST-03 EPIC-02, BLG-FEAT-20). The endpoint is in `docs/reference/openapi.yaml` (line 1571) but has no performance baseline entry in `docs/ops/api_performance_baseline.md`. Endpoint coverage drift — measurement gap for the new costs endpoint.

**Scope**
- Measure PATCH /trades/{id}/costs p50/p95 latency using the standard §19 methodology from a representative request
- Add the measurement row to `docs/ops/api_performance_baseline.md`

**Acceptance Criteria**
- PATCH /trades/{id}/costs entry added to api_performance_baseline.md with p50, p95, and measurement date
- Measurement taken from Render internal logs or live test

**Type:** Backend Engineering / Performance
**Owner:** Infrastructure & Operations Owner; Head of Engineering
**Source:** IDEA-infra-ops-20260619-01 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-19__scheduled (DL-049)
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** Unscheduled (before Arc 4 sprint planning)

**Problem**
Arc 4 (PO-02/03/04) will introduce cross-table queries joining trade_plans, red_flag_events, arc5_compliance_scores, and potentially new journal tables. The current index strategy was designed for Arc 1–3 query patterns. Without an audit, Arc 4 sprint delivery may encounter unexpected latency regressions on production Supabase once real data volumes are involved.

**Scope**
- Review current index coverage on trade_plans, red_flag_events, arc5_compliance_scores, ai_journal_summaries tables
- Model likely Arc 4 query patterns based on BLG-SPEC-56 pre-authored contracts
- Identify missing indexes; file BLG-OPS or BLG-BE items for each gap discovered
- Document in `docs/operations/` or `docs/data_models/`

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Index audit document produced covering Arc 4 query patterns
- Any missing indexes produce separate BLG items before sign-off
- Reviewed by Infrastructure & Operations Owner

### BLG-GOV-131 — Governance overhead ceiling metric and accountability mechanism
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Governance / Process
**Owner:** PMO Lead; Challenger
**Source:** IDEA-challenger-20260619-02 — Promoted-Backlog rebalance 2026-06-19__scheduled (DL-049); elevated to P2 given Product Value Alert (user_value_ratio=0.093) and Skill-Silo Alert (G+D+P=90.7% last 5 cycles)
**Effort:** S (~0.5–1 day)
**Provisional-Target:** v6.1

**Problem**
The Skill-Silo ceiling (40% G+D+P per sprint) was added to roadmap_prompt.md v7.4 but operates at the sprint planning gate. There is no mechanism for reporting governance overhead at the cycle level (across sprints), flagging trends before they compound, or providing accountability at the rebalance level. The Product Value Alert (user_value_ratio=0.093 across last 5 cycles) demonstrates that cycle-level governance overhead can persist without a visible metric, even when individual sprint gates pass. A governance overhead ceiling metric would surface this pattern earlier.

**Scope**
- Define a governance overhead metric: G+D+P% over a rolling cycle window (matching STEP 2.4 last-5-cycles window)
- Define alert threshold (current ceiling: 40% per sprint → rolling 5-cycle ceiling: 60% as initial proposal)
- Propose where in the roadmap rebalance workflow this metric is reported (STEP 2.4 or new STEP 2.5)
- Draft a one-paragraph amendment to roadmap_prompt.md STEP 2 for Head of Specs Team review
- Document as a proposal doc; implementation requires Head of Specs Team sign-off per §6 governance edit checklist

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Governance overhead ceiling metric defined (formula, rolling window, alert threshold)
- Proposal document produced for Head of Specs Team and PMO Lead review
- If approved: roadmap_prompt.md amendment drafted and queued for GOVERNANCE commit per §6 checklist

### BLG-GOV-132 — Release planning: emit explicit Design Gate Required flag for UI-facing scope
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Type:** Governance Process
**Owner:** Head of Specs Team; PMO Lead
**Source:** v6.0 design gate — design gate was skipped because release planning emitted no explicit "design gate required" signal, allowing sprint planning to start out of sequence — 2026-06-19
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** v6.1

**Problem**
When the release planning engine produces a backlog slice containing user-facing UI items it does not set a machine-readable flag or emit a prominent advisory that the design gate must run before sprint planning. The PMO Lead has no automated signal to distinguish "design gate required" from "design gate not required" cycles. In v6.0 this omission led to sprint planning starting from Release_Planning_Complete with design_gate_status = not_started and no bypass recorded, requiring a lifecycle guard halt and manual state restoration.

**Scope**
- STEP 4 of release_planning_prompt.md: scan backlog slice items for UI-facing delegation class (delegated_frontend, autonomous with observable UI ACs); classify cycle as design gate required or not required
- Set `design_gate_required = true | false` in cycle/state.json and .claude_current_state.json at STEP 4 completion (additive — does not overwrite other fields)
- Emit prominent advisory in release planning output: "⚠ DESIGN GATE REQUIRED before plan sprint — N items classified as UI-facing. Run: run design-gate --cycle <cycle_id>"
- When no UI-facing items: set false and emit "Design Gate: Not Required — proceed directly to plan sprint"
- Include design_gate_required status in cycle_summary.md header section
- Bump release_planning_prompt.md version; update §14 OPERATIONAL_GUIDE.md and prompt_change_log.md

**Acceptance Criteria**
- AC-01: Backlog slice with UI-facing items → release planning output includes "⚠ DESIGN GATE REQUIRED" and design_gate_required = true in cycle/state.json
- AC-02: Backlog slice with no UI-facing items → design_gate_required = false; advisory says "Design Gate: Not Required"
- AC-03: cycle_summary.md header includes design_gate_required status line
- AC-04: release_planning_prompt.md version bumped; §14 and prompt_change_log.md updated in same commit per §6 governance edit checklist

### BLG-GOV-133 — Sprint planning: enforce hard gate on design_gate_status at STEP -1 preflight
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Type:** Governance Process
**Owner:** Head of Specs Team; PMO Lead
**Source:** v6.0 design gate — sprint planning proceeded from Release_Planning_Complete with design_gate_status = not_started and no bypass record — 2026-06-19
**Effort:** S (~0.5 day)
**Provisional-Target:** v6.1

**Problem**
The lifecycle schema and shared_standards §10.1 specify that sprint planning entering from Release_Planning_Complete requires either design_gate_status = Passed or explicit bypass fields (design_gate_bypass_authority + design_gate_bypass_reason). However, sprint planning's own STEP -1 preflight did not enforce this as a hard gate — it was possible to proceed with design_gate_status = not_started and no bypass, producing an uncommitted out-of-sequence artefact set. The schema is correct; the prompt enforcement is missing.

**Scope**
- Add or strengthen STEP -1.3 in sprint_planning_prompt.md: when entering from Release_Planning_Complete, explicitly check design_gate_status before any further step
- Hard gate rule (fires if design_gate_required = true): design_gate_status ≠ Passed AND (design_gate_bypass_authority empty OR design_gate_bypass_reason empty) → halt with halt report, status = Blocked
- Bypass path: bypass authority + reason both populated → proceed with bypass acknowledgement appended to sprint planning notes (not silent)
- Pass path: design_gate_status = Passed → proceed normally; log "Design gate: Passed" in output
- If design_gate_required = false: skip gate; note "Design gate: Not Required for this cycle"
- Bump sprint_planning_prompt.md version; update §14 OPERATIONAL_GUIDE.md and prompt_change_log.md

**Acceptance Criteria**
- AC-01: plan sprint from Release_Planning_Complete with design_gate_required = true, design_gate_status = not_started, no bypass → hard gate fires, halt report, status = Blocked
- AC-02: plan sprint from Release_Planning_Complete with bypass authority + reason populated → proceeds with bypass acknowledgement in sprint planning notes
- AC-03: plan sprint from Design_Gate_Passed → proceeds normally; gate check logged as Pass
- AC-04: plan sprint with design_gate_required = false → gate check skipped; noted in output
- AC-05: sprint_planning_prompt.md version bumped; §14 and prompt_change_log.md updated same commit

### BLG-FE-76 — Portfolio sector heat-map visualization
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Frontend / UX / Data Visualisation
**Owner:** Product Owner; Frontend Specs & UX Documentation Owner
**Source:** IDEA-product-owner-20260619-01 — Promoted-Backlog (via STEP 5 debate) rebalance 2026-06-19__scheduled (DL-050); Challenger Product Velocity Concern supports — product value ratio 0.093 mandates user-facing investment
**Effort:** M (~2–3 days)
**Provisional-Target:** v6.1

**Problem**
Current portfolio view (positions, heat, P&L) has no sector-level aggregation. A trader running 3–5 positions across sectors cannot see at a glance whether they are sector-concentrated (e.g. 60% Technology, 20% Energy, 20% Healthcare). The sector data already exists: DS-03 (v2.9) added sector/industry enrichment to the screener and ticker universe. A heat-map that surfaces portfolio sector weight (by exposure %) would immediately help the user spot concentration risk and make more balanced entry decisions.

**Scope**
- Frontend: `SectorHeatMap.js` component — percentage bars or tile grid by sector, coloured by exposure level
- Backend: derive sector weights from existing positions data + ticker sector_name field; no new data provider
- Integration: add to the Portfolio or Dashboard page
- Spec: one endpoint or query approach to be defined by Head of Specs Team

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Sector heat-map component visible on Portfolio or Dashboard page
- Each sector displays: name, position count, exposure % of portfolio
- Concentration alert (e.g. > 40% in one sector) highlighted visually
- Playwright E2E coverage for at least one sector concentration scenario

### BLG-FE-77 — Refactor `Watchlist.js` to ESLint compliance
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Frontend / UX
**Owner:** Head of Frontend Engineering
**Source:** ESLint hook run — pre-existing violations surfaced after eslint-plugin-playwright, eslint-plugin-no-comments, eslint-plugin-better-max-params installed — 2026-06-22
**Effort:** M (~1–2 days)
**Provisional-Target:** v6.1

**Problem**
`src/pages/Watchlist.js` has 16 pre-existing ESLint violations that were hidden because three required plugins were not installed. Now that the plugins are in place, the lint-feedback hook fires on every edit to this file, creating noise and discouraging changes. The primary violations are: `max-lines-per-function` (the `Watchlist` component body is 312 lines against a 50-line limit), multiple magic number literals (`200`, `220`, `5`, `60`, `1000`), and inline comments in state declarations. Zero violations were introduced by recent changes — all are pre-existing.

**Scope**
- Extract sub-components from `Watchlist.js`: `WatchlistTableRow`, `WatchlistNewsRow`, and inline badges are all candidates
- Replace magic number literals with named constants at the top of the file
- Remove inline comments; express intent through component and variable names instead
- Ensure all extracted components independently pass ESLint

**Acceptance Criteria**
- `npx eslint src/pages/Watchlist.js` exits 0 with no errors or warnings
- All extracted sub-components also pass ESLint clean
- Watchlist page renders and behaves identically to pre-refactor (no functional regression)
- Playwright E2E watchlist specs continue to pass
