## Priority Definitions

- **P0 — Critical**: Blocks correctness, trust, or release safety
- **P1 — High**: Enables core workflows or governance
- **P2 — Medium**: High leverage but not blocking
- **P3 — Low**: Nice-to-have or future scale

---

## 1. Platform & Validation Governance Backlog

These items ensure analytical correctness, validation integrity, and operational safety.
They are not user-facing, but they directly affect trust in outputs and release confidence.

---

### BLG-TECH-01 — Fix Sharpe variance method + Capital Efficiency currency basis
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Type:** Metrics Correctness / Validation Integrity
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-02-21

**Closed**
- `_calculate_sharpe()` updated to use sample variance (÷ n−1) for portfolio and trade-level Sharpe methods
- Capital efficiency updated to use `Mean(total_cost)` in GBP from `trade_history`
- `validation_data.py` expected values updated: `capital_efficiency` 0.17 → 0.22; `total_cost` fields added
- Validation: 13/13 pass confirmed at 2026-02-21T00:24:41Z
- Canonical Owner sign-off: 2026-02-21
- `metrics_definitions.md` v1.5.7 — Appendix E both items marked resolved
- `analytics_endpoints.md` v1.8.1 — resolved known limitations removed
- v1.6 quality gate: satisfied

---

BLG-TECH-02 — Implement validation severity model
Priority: P1 (High)
Type: Governance / Operational Control
Status: ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-02-21
Closed

severity field added to every validation result object (critical / high / medium / low)
by_severity aggregation added to summary — all four tiers always present
Severity mapping implemented in ValidationService per analytics_endpoints.md v1.8.1
Director of Quality sign-off: 2026-02-21T21:30:00Z
Phase Gate Document filed: docs/product/phase_gates/BLG-TECH-02-validation-severity-model-phase-gate.md

---

BLG-TECH-03 — Consolidate ValidationService into service layer
Priority: P1 (High)
Type: Architecture / Maintainability
Status: ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-02-21
Closed

All validation logic moved from routers/validation.py into services/validation_service.py
Router thinned to HTTP in/out only — delegates entirely to ValidationService.validate_all()
Stub replaced with full 13-metric + trade-Sharpe implementation
Delivered in same branch as BLG-TECH-02 per co-delivery constraint
Director of Quality sign-off: 2026-02-21T21:30:00Z
Phase Gate Document filed: docs/product/phase_gates/BLG-TECH-03-validationservice-consolidation-phase-gate.md

### BLG-TECH-04 — CI/CD validation workflow (GitHub Actions)
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Delivery Quality / Automation
**Target release:** v1.7

**Problem**
- Validation is manual and not enforced at merge time.

**Scope**
- Add `.github/workflows/validate-analytics.yml`.
- Run `POST /validate/calculations` on:
  - Pull requests
  - Pushes to `main` and `develop`
- Block merge if any **critical-severity** validation fails.
- Post validation summary as PR comment.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Workflow reliably runs on all PRs.
- Merge is blocked only for critical severity failures.
- Clear PR feedback is visible.

**Dependencies**
- BLG-TECH-02 (severity model must exist).

**Owners**
- Engineering
- QA

---

### BLG-TECH-05 — Prometheus metrics endpoint
**Priority:** P3 (Low — v2.1 candidate)
**Type:** Observability

**Scope**
- Add `GET /metrics` Prometheus endpoint exposing:
  - Validation run count
  - Failure count by metric and severity
  - Validation duration
- Optional Grafana dashboard.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Metrics scrape successfully in Prometheus format.
- Counters and histograms are correct.

**Target**
- v2.1 or when system becomes multi-user.

**BLG-TECH-06** — Canonicalise sharpe_ratio_trade_method as 14th validation metric in analytics_endpoints.md
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Spec Accuracy / Governance
**Target release:** v1.7 *(updated from v1.6.1 — v1.6.1 has shipped; DL-001 cycle 2026-03-01__item-3.2)*
**Status:** Open
**Problem**
POST /validate/calculations returns 14 validation results. analytics_endpoints.md v1.8.1
describes 13 metrics and does not document sharpe_ratio_trade_method.
The 14th metric was introduced under BLG-TECH-01 Addendum 1 (PMO-confirmed scope, 2026-02-20)
to exercise the trade-based Sharpe fallback path. The implementation is correct and the result
passes. The spec is incomplete.
This was recorded as OBS-01 by the QA Lead during BLG-TECH-02/03 re-verification
(2026-02-21T21:25:00Z) and formally acknowledged by the Product Owner (2026-02-21).
Per document_lifecycle_guide.md v2.2 — deviation must have priority, target release,
and owner at time of documentation. These are recorded here.
Scope

Update analytics_endpoints.md to add sharpe_ratio_trade_method as a formally
documented 14th validation metric
Add to the validated metrics table with: severity critical, formula, tolerance
Update the response example to show 14 results and correct by_severity.critical.total: 4
No code change required — implementation is correct

**Acceptance Criteria**

analytics_endpoints.md validated metrics table includes sharpe_ratio_trade_method
Response schema example reflects 14 results
by_severity.critical.total shown as 4 in example (not 3)
No deviation exists between the spec and the live POST /validate/calculations response

**BLG-TECH-08** — Align portfolio_endpoints.md positions summary field list
**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** ~30 min
**Target release:** v1.7
**Source:** OBS-QWB-R1-01 — QA Lead observation, QWB verification, 2026-03-01
GET /portfolio positions summary objects omit current_price_native, stop_price,
stop_price_native, and pnl_percent — fields listed in R-01 test scenario step 3
and in portfolio_endpoints.md. Pre-existing behaviour, not introduced by QWB.
Decision required: Either (a) update portfolio_endpoints.md to accurately document
the lightweight summary shape, explicitly distinguishing it from the full position object
on GET /positions; or (b) add the missing fields to the backend response. Product Owner

API Contracts owner to decide.

**Acceptance Criteria**

portfolio_endpoints.md positions summary field list matches the live API response
No discrepancy between spec and implementation for /portfolio positions objects

**BLG-TECH-09** — Add holding_days to GET /trades response
**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** ~1 hour
**Target release:** v1.7
**Source:** OBS-QWB-R3-01 — QA Lead observation, QWB verification, 2026-03-01
holding_days is absent from trade objects in the GET /trades response.
trade_endpoints.md v1.8.4 lists it as a required field. Pre-existing behaviour,
not introduced by QWB.
Decision required: Either (a) add holding_days to the backend GET /trades
response (the spec-compliant fix); or (b) remove holding_days from trade_endpoints.md
documented schema. Product Owner + API Contracts owner to decide.
Acceptance Criteria

GET /trades trade objects include holding_days (integer), OR
trade_endpoints.md schema is corrected to remove the field, with a note explaining
its absence and where the value can be sourced (e.g. trades_for_charts)

- Social / community features
- Options and futures trading support

---

## 5. Lifecycle Governance Notes

- This backlog is not canonical and must never override:
  - Strategy rules
  - Metrics definitions
  - API contracts
- Any shipped feature must be backed by:
  - Canonical specification
  - Updated validation where applicable
- Once implemented, backlog items are superseded by canonical documentation.

## Test Coverage Gaps (from Delivery Verification)

- [TEST-GAP-EPIC-06] Test scenario coverage gap from 2026-03-02__release-v1.7: QA & Testing Owner to create scenarios per verification_report.md §6 (Test Coverage Assessment). Gaps: no scenarios asserting sharpe_ratio_trade_method presence in /validate/calculations response (14 metrics); no scenario asserting portfolio_endpoints.md field alignment; no scenario asserting holding_days in GET /trades. Target: pre-next sprint on analytics, portfolio, or trade endpoint domains.
