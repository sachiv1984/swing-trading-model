### BLG-NEW-08 — Automated OpenAPI Drift Detection in CI

**Status at retirement:** ✅ Complete
**Priority at retirement:** P1
**Retired:** 2026-03-06
**Shipped in:** v1.8
**Evidence:** Cycle 2026-03-04__release-v1.8 | ST-08

### BLG-NEW-08 — Automated OpenAPI Drift Detection in CI ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Type:** CI / Governance
**Owner:** Engineering (CI)
**Source:** IW-20260304-01 (promoted 2026-03-04)
**Cycle added:** 2026-03-04__item-3.4
**Effort:** ~0.5 day
**Closed:** 2026-03-06 | Cycle: 2026-03-04__release-v1.8 | ST-08

**Problem**
`docs/reference/openapi.yaml` was not updated during EPIC-06 when three contracts were bumped to v1.9.0 (BLG-SPEC-D7). There is no CI check that detects drift between the markdown API contracts and openapi.yaml. Drift will recur without an automated gate.

**Scope**
- Add a CI step that detects drift between `openapi.yaml` and the markdown API contracts
- Approach: either (a) generate openapi.yaml from contracts and compare, or (b) run a custom lint/diff check against known contract fields
- Block merge on detected drift

**Acceptance Criteria**
- CI step detects drift between openapi.yaml and markdown contracts
- Merge blocked if drift is detected
- Approach documented (generation vs diff) — approach decision to be made in pre-alignment

### BLG-NEW-07 — Running API Changelog Document

**Status at retirement:** ✅ Complete
**Priority at retirement:** P1
**Retired:** 2026-03-06
**Shipped in:** v1.8
**Evidence:** Cycle 2026-03-04__release-v1.8 | ST-12

### BLG-NEW-07 — Running API Changelog Document ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Type:** Documentation / Governance
**Owner:** API Contracts & Documentation Owner
**Source:** IW-20260304-01 (promoted 2026-03-04)
**Cycle added:** 2026-03-04__item-3.4
**Effort:** ~0.5 day
**Closed:** 2026-03-06 | Cycle: 2026-03-04__release-v1.8 | ST-12

**Problem**
There is no single running changelog document for API contract changes. Changes to endpoint contracts (new fields, removed fields, version bumps) are recorded in individual spec files but there is no centralised, human-readable history of API evolution across versions.

**Scope**
- Create a running API Changelog document that summarises contract changes per version
- Cover all contracts under `docs/specs/api_contracts/`
- Backfill from v1.8.x → v1.9.0 changes (EPIC-06 scope)
- Document maintainer obligation: must be updated alongside every contract version bump

**Acceptance Criteria**
- API Changelog document exists and is registered in Specs_Index.md
- All v1.9.0 contract changes (EPIC-06) are backfilled
- Maintenance obligation documented alongside contract spec authoring workflow

### BLG-NEW-05 — Dependency Vulnerability Scanning in CI

**Status at retirement:** ✅ Complete
**Priority at retirement:** P1
**Retired:** 2026-03-06
**Shipped in:** v1.8
**Evidence:** Cycle 2026-03-04__release-v1.8 | ST-07

### BLG-NEW-05 — Dependency Vulnerability Scanning in CI ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Type:** Security / CI
**Owner:** Engineering (CI)
**Source:** IW-20260304-01 (promoted 2026-03-04)
**Cycle added:** 2026-03-04__item-3.4
**Effort:** ~0.5 day
**Closed:** 2026-03-06 | Cycle: 2026-03-04__release-v1.8 | ST-07

**Problem**
There is no automated scanning of Python dependencies for known vulnerabilities in the CI pipeline. A compromised or vulnerable dependency could be introduced silently.

**Scope**
- Add a CI step that scans Python dependencies (e.g., using `pip-audit` or `safety`) for known CVEs
- Block merge (or warn at configurable severity) on high/critical vulnerabilities
- Integrate with existing `.github/workflows/` structure

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Dependency vulnerability scan runs on every PR
- High/critical CVEs block merge (or produce a required review comment)
- Scan tool and severity threshold documented

### BLG-NEW-03 — Define and Document Unavailability Failure Mode

**Status at retirement:** ✅ Complete
**Priority at retirement:** P1
**Retired:** 2026-03-06
**Shipped in:** v1.8
**Evidence:** Cycle 2026-03-04__release-v1.8 | ST-11

### BLG-NEW-03 — Define and Document Unavailability Failure Mode ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Type:** Policy / Governance
**Owner:** Infrastructure & Operations Owner
**Source:** IW-20260304-01 (promoted 2026-03-04)
**Cycle added:** 2026-03-04__item-3.4
**Effort:** ~0.5 day
**Closed:** 2026-03-06 | Cycle: 2026-03-04__release-v1.8 | ST-11

**Problem**
There is no documented policy for what happens when the system is unavailable during a trading session (e.g., backend down, market data feed unavailable). The system has no documented failure modes or fallback procedures for the user.

**Scope**
- Define and document the unavailability failure mode: what the user should do, what the system state is, and any manual fallback procedures
- Document where this policy lives (e.g., OPERATIONAL_GUIDE.md or a new docs/ops/ document)

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Unavailability failure mode documented: system states covered, user action required, data integrity implications
- Document registered in appropriate governance index

### BLG-NEW-02 — Backtest vs Live Stop Reconciliation Report

**Status at retirement:** ✅ Complete
**Priority at retirement:** P1
**Retired:** 2026-03-06
**Shipped in:** v1.8
**Evidence:** Cycle 2026-03-04__release-v1.8 | ST-06

### BLG-NEW-02 — Backtest vs Live Stop Reconciliation Report ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Type:** Quality / CI
**Owner:** Engineering + QA
**Source:** IW-20260304-01 (promoted 2026-03-04)
**Cycle added:** 2026-03-04__item-3.4
**Dependency:** After BLG-NEW-01 (golden output baseline must be in place first)
**Closed:** 2026-03-06 | Cycle: 2026-03-04__release-v1.8 | ST-06

**Problem**
There is no automated verification that the trailing stop formula used in backtests and the formula used in the live system produce identical results for the same inputs. Silent divergence between backtest and live logic is a category of defect that cannot be caught by either gate independently.

**Scope**
- Report or CI assertion that compares backtest stop calculations vs live system stop calculations for a set of known inputs
- Output: reconciliation result confirming parity or flagging divergence

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Automated check exists that verifies backtest and live stop logic produce identical results for all golden inputs
- Any divergence between backtest and live calculation fails the check

### BLG-NEW-01 — Golden Output Regression Baseline for CI

**Status at retirement:** ✅ Complete
**Priority at retirement:** P1
**Retired:** 2026-03-06
**Shipped in:** v1.8
**Evidence:** Cycle 2026-03-04__release-v1.8 | ST-05

### BLG-NEW-01 — Golden Output Regression Baseline for CI ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Type:** Quality / CI
**Owner:** Engineering + QA
**Source:** IDEA-director-of-quality-20260304-02 — Director of Quality, IW-20260304-01
**Cycle added:** 2026-03-04__item-3.4
**Closed:** 2026-03-06 | Cycle: 2026-03-04__release-v1.8 | ST-05

**Problem**
The current CI gate (`POST /validate/calculations`, EPIC-01) checks only that `critical_failed > 0` blocks the merge. It does not verify that specific calculations return the correct numeric values. A change that silently alters the trailing stop formula from `CurrentPrice - (2 × ATR)` to `CurrentPrice - (2.1 × ATR)` would pass the current gate. Numeric regressions are the highest-risk defect class in a trading system.

**Scope**
- Define a set of deterministic golden test cases: known inputs (entry_price, ATR, risk_percent, etc.) with expected output values derived directly from the canonical strategy spec
- Store as `tests/golden_outputs.json` — treated as a canonical artefact; updated only via spec-linked PR
- Scope limited to stop/sizing calculations only (per STEP 5 scoping from IW-20260304-01)
- Add a CI step that calls the backend with each golden input and asserts output matches to required precision
- Any numeric divergence from golden values fails the build

**Acceptance Criteria**
- `tests/golden_outputs.json` exists with spec-derived golden values for stop and sizing calculations
- CI step added that runs golden output assertions on every PR
- Build fails on any numeric deviation from golden values
- Precision tolerance documented (e.g., 4 decimal places for share counts)
- Golden values derived from canonical spec, not from current implementation

**Dependencies**
- None (prerequisite: BLG-NEW-02 must follow, not precede)

### BLG-SPEC-D7 — openapi.yaml frozen at v1.8.1

**Status at retirement:** ✅ Complete
**Priority at retirement:** P2
**Retired:** 2026-03-06
**Shipped in:** v1.8
**Evidence:** Cycle 2026-03-04__release-v1.8 | ST-10

### BLG-SPEC-D7 — openapi.yaml frozen at v1.8.1; not updated for v1.9.0 contracts ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Documentation Drift / Reference Artefact Staleness
**Owner:** API Contracts & Documentation Owner
**Raised:** 2026-03-03 — Head of Specs Team review
**Closed:** 2026-03-06 | Cycle: 2026-03-04__release-v1.8 | ST-10 — openapi.yaml updated to v1.9.0

**Problem**
`docs/reference/openapi.yaml` is at version 1.8.1 (1193 lines).
Three contracts were bumped to v1.9.0 in EPIC-06:
- `sharpe_ratio_trade_method` absent from /validate/calculations validated metrics list
- portfolio positions response schema not aligned to v1.9.0 field list
- `holding_days` absent from GET /trades trade object schema
Specs_Index.md §4 states: "openapi.yaml must be reviewed inline with every contract change; markdown contracts take precedence on conflict."
This was not done during EPIC-06.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- openapi.yaml version field updated to 1.9.0
- /validate/calculations response includes sharpe_ratio_trade_method (14 validated metrics total)
- GET /trades trade object includes holding_days (integer)
- GET /portfolio positions objects reflect v1.9.0 field list
- No conflicts between openapi.yaml and markdown contracts

### BLG-SPEC-D2 — settings_endpoints.md spec/implementation mismatch

**Status at retirement:** ✅ Complete
**Priority at retirement:** P1
**Retired:** 2026-03-06
**Shipped in:** v1.8
**Evidence:** Cycle 2026-03-04__release-v1.8 | ST-09

### BLG-SPEC-D2 — settings_endpoints.md spec/implementation mismatch ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Type:** Spec–Implementation Drift
**Owner:** API Contracts & Documentation Owner + Head of Engineering
**Raised:** 2026-03-03 — Head of Specs Team review
**Closed:** 2026-03-06 | Cycle: 2026-03-04__release-v1.8 | ST-09 — settings_endpoints.md v1.1.0 published; PATCH/POST documented as canonical

**Problem**
`docs/specs/api_contracts/settings_endpoints.md` specifies `PUT /settings` (replace all settings).
Live implementation in `backend/main.py` uses `PATCH /settings/{settings_id}` (update single setting by ID).
Additionally, `POST /settings` is implemented but not documented anywhere.
This is a P1 drift: clients relying on the spec will call the wrong method and path.

**Decision Required**
Product Owner + API Contracts owner to choose:
(a) Update spec to document `PATCH /settings/{settings_id}` and `POST /settings` as the canonical interface, or
(b) Align backend to implement `PUT /settings` as specced (breaking change to existing frontend).

**Acceptance Criteria**
- settings_endpoints.md accurately documents the live HTTP method, path, and request/response schema
- No divergence between spec and implementation
- Decision record filed if option (b) chosen (breaking change)

**Source:** OBS-QWB-R3-01 — QA Lead observation, QWB verification, 2026-03-01
holding_days is absent from trade objects in the GET /trades response.
trade_endpoints.md v1.8.4 lists it as a required field. Pre-existing behaviour,
not introduced by QWB.
Decision required: Either (a) add holding_days to the backend GET /trades
response (the spec-compliant fix); or (b) remove holding_days from trade_endpoints.md
documented schema. Product Owner + API Contracts owner to decide.
Acceptance Criteria

GET /trades trade objects include holding_days (integer), OR
trade_endpoints.md schema is corrected to remove the field, with a note explaining
its absence and where the value can be sourced (e.g. trades_for_charts)

### BLG-TECH-06 — Canonicalise sharpe_ratio_trade_method as 14th validation metric

**Status at retirement:** ✅ Complete
**Priority at retirement:** P2

**Evidence:** Cycle 2026-03-02__release-v1.7, EPIC-06/TASK-21–24; `claude/cycles/2026-03-02__release-v1.7/verification_report.md`

**BLG-TECH-06** — Canonicalise sharpe_ratio_trade_method as 14th validation metric in analytics_endpoints.md
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Spec Accuracy / Governance
**Target release:** v1.7 *(updated from v1.6.1 — v1.6.1 has shipped; DL-001 cycle 2026-03-01__item-3.2)*
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-03 (cycle: 2026-03-02__release-v1.7, EPIC-06/TASK-21–24)
**Problem**
POST /validate/calculations returns 14 validation results. analytics_endpoints.md v1.8.1
describes 13 metrics and does not document sharpe_ratio_trade_method.
The 14th metric was introduced under BLG-TECH-01 Addendum 1 (PMO-confirmed scope, 2026-02-20)
to exercise the trade-based Sharpe fallback path. The implementation is correct and the result
passes. The spec is incomplete.
This was recorded as OBS-01 by the QA Lead during BLG-TECH-02/03 re-verification
(2026-02-21T21:25:00Z) and formally acknowledged by the Product Owner (2026-02-21).
Per document_lifecycle_guide.md v2.2 — deviation must have priority, target release,
and owner at time of documentation. These are recorded here.
Scope

Update analytics_endpoints.md to add sharpe_ratio_trade_method as a formally
documented 14th validation metric
Add to the validated metrics table with: severity critical, formula, tolerance
Update the response example to show 14 results and correct by_severity.critical.total: 4
No code change required — implementation is correct

**Acceptance Criteria**

analytics_endpoints.md validated metrics table includes sharpe_ratio_trade_method
Response schema example reflects 14 results
by_severity.critical.total shown as 4 in example (not 3)
No deviation exists between the spec and the live POST /validate/calculations response
