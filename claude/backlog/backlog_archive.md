### BLG-TECH-09 — Add holding_days to GET /trades

**Status at retirement:** ✅ Complete
**Priority at retirement:** P3
**Retired:** 2026-03-04

**Evidence:** Cycle 2026-03-02__release-v1.7, EPIC-06/TASK-28–30; `claude/cycles/2026-03-02__release-v1.7/verification_report.md`

**BLG-TECH-09** — Add holding_days to GET /trades
**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** ~1 hour
**Target release:** v1.7
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-03 (cycle: 2026-03-02__release-v1.7, EPIC-06/TASK-28–30; backend fix path chosen)
**Source:** OBS-QWB-R3-01 — QA Lead observation, QWB verification, 2026-03-01
holding_days is absent from trade objects in the GET /trades response.
trade_endpoints.md v1.8.4 lists it as a required field. Pre-existing behaviour,
not introduced by QWB.
Decision required: Either (a) add holding_days to the backend GET /trades
response (the spec-compliant fix); or (b) remove holding_days from trade_endpoints.md
documented schema. Product Owner + API Contracts owner to decide.
Acceptance Criteria

GET /trades trade objects include holding_days (integer), OR
trade_endpoints.md schema is corrected to remove the field, with a note explaining
its absence and where the value can be sourced (e.g. trades_for_charts)

### BLG-TECH-08 — Align portfolio_endpoints.md positions summary field list

**Status at retirement:** ✅ Complete
**Priority at retirement:** P3

**Evidence:** Cycle 2026-03-02__release-v1.7, EPIC-06/TASK-25–27; `claude/cycles/2026-03-02__release-v1.7/verification_report.md`

**BLG-TECH-08** — Align portfolio_endpoints.md positions summary field list
**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** ~30 min
**Target release:** v1.7
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-03 (cycle: 2026-03-02__release-v1.7, EPIC-06/TASK-25–27; spec update path chosen)
**Source:** OBS-QWB-R1-01 — QA Lead observation, QWB verification, 2026-03-01
GET /portfolio positions summary objects omit current_price_native, stop_price,
stop_price_native, and pnl_percent — fields listed in R-01 test scenario step 3
and in portfolio_endpoints.md. Pre-existing behaviour, not introduced by QWB.
Decision required: Either (a) update portfolio_endpoints.md to accurately document
the lightweight summary shape, explicitly distinguishing it from the full position object
on GET /positions; or (b) add the missing fields to the backend response. Product Owner

API Contracts owner to decide.

**Acceptance Criteria**

portfolio_endpoints.md positions summary field list matches the live API response
No discrepancy between spec and implementation for /portfolio positions objects

### BLG-TECH-06 — Canonicalise sharpe_ratio_trade_method as 14th validation metric

**Status at retirement:** ✅ Complete
**Priority at retirement:** P2
**Retired:** 2026-03-04
**Shipped in:** v1.7
**Evidence:** Cycle 2026-03-02__release-v1.7, EPIC-06/TASK-21–24; `claude/cycles/2026-03-02__release-v1.7/verification_report.md`

**BLG-TECH-06** — Canonicalise sharpe_ratio_trade_method as 14th validation metric in analytics_endpoints.md
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Spec Accuracy / Governance
**Target release:** v1.7 *(updated from v1.6.1 — v1.6.1 has shipped; DL-001 cycle 2026-03-01__item-3.2)*
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-03-03 (cycle: 2026-03-02__release-v1.7, EPIC-06/TASK-21–24)
**Problem**
POST /validate/calculations returns 14 validation results. analytics_endpoints.md v1.8.1
describes 13 metrics and does not document sharpe_ratio_trade_method.
The 14th metric was introduced under BLG-TECH-01 Addendum 1 (PMO-confirmed scope, 2026-02-20)
to exercise the trade-based Sharpe fallback path. The implementation is correct and the result
passes. The spec is incomplete.
This was recorded as OBS-01 by the QA Lead during BLG-TECH-02/03 re-verification
(2026-02-21T21:25:00Z) and formally acknowledged by the Product Owner (2026-02-21).
Per document_lifecycle_guide.md v2.2 — deviation must have priority, target release,
and owner at time of documentation. These are recorded here.
Scope

Update analytics_endpoints.md to add sharpe_ratio_trade_method as a formally
documented 14th validation metric
Add to the validated metrics table with: severity critical, formula, tolerance
Update the response example to show 14 results and correct by_severity.critical.total: 4
No code change required — implementation is correct

**Acceptance Criteria**

analytics_endpoints.md validated metrics table includes sharpe_ratio_trade_method
Response schema example reflects 14 results
by_severity.critical.total shown as 4 in example (not 3)
No deviation exists between the spec and the live POST /validate/calculations response
