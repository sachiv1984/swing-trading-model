# Roadmap Decision Log

## Purpose

This document records **explicit roadmap decisions** made from this point forward.

It exists to:
- Preserve rationale for Add / Replace / Defer / Kill decisions
- Make trade‑offs and opportunity cost visible
- Provide an audit trail for roadmap evolution

This document does **not** attempt to reconstruct historical decisions made prior to its creation.

---

## Scope & Start Point

- Decisions are recorded **from the first Claude‑executed roadmap rebalance onward**
- Earlier roadmap changes are out of scope and intentionally undocumented
- Absence of an entry implies the decision predates formal logging

This is deliberate.

---

## Decision Entries

Each decision entry must include:

- Date
- Decision type (Add / Replace / Defer / Kill)
- Initiative(s) affected
- Explicit rationale
- Displacement (if applicable)
- Decision owner

## Decisions

<!-- Decision entries are appended below this line -->

### DL-001 — 2026-03-01

**Decision type:** Kill
**Cycle:** 2026-03-01__item-3.2
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Decision owner:** Product Owner

**Initiative:** 4.1a — CSV Export of Trade History

**Displacement:** N/A — superseded item; no active work displaced.

**Workforce impact:** None. BLG-FEAT-07 already delivered this feature; no ongoing allocation existed.

**Rationale:** BLG-FEAT-07 (CSV Export of Trade History) was delivered as part of the QWB Quick Wins Bundle and shipped in v1.6.1 (2026-03-01) with Director of Quality sign-off. The roadmap item 4.1a explicitly stated: "If BLG-FEAT-07 ships in v1.6.1, this item is superseded." That condition is satisfied. Retaining an active planning item with no remaining work creates false planning debt and violates lifecycle integrity.

### DL-002 — 2026-03-01

**Decision type:** Modify (pre-conditions elevated from advisory to hard gates)
**Cycle:** 2026-03-01__item-3.2
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Decision owner:** Product Owner

**Initiative:** 3.5 — Alerts & Notifications (v2.0)

**Displacement:** N/A — existing roadmap item; no new addition.

**Workforce impact:** No change to allocated workforce. Hard gates prevent premature resource allocation.

**Rationale:** The three pre-conditions for 3.5 Alerts (observability standards, API versioning decision record, QA planning session for notification delivery) were advisory notes in the prior roadmap version. The structured debate Challenger raised a valid concern that advisory notes do not prevent premature pre-alignment opening — specifically, that async failure modes would be unobservable and notification delivery would ship without adequate QA coverage if pre-alignment opened before these were complete. Product Owner accepted the modification: all three pre-conditions are elevated to explicit hard gates. v2.0 pre-alignment may not open until all three are confirmed. Feature remains v2.0; no change to roadmap position.
