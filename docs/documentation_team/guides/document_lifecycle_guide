# Document Lifecycle Guide

**Owner:** Head of Specs Team  
**Scope:** Documentation upkeep (not code, not delivery, not enforcement)  
**Applies to:** Specs, contracts, frontend docs, metrics docs, data model docs, indexes  
**Status:** Canonical governance guide

---

## 1) Why this exists
This guide ensures documentation remains:
- **Coherent** across domains
- **Authoritative** over tribal knowledge
- **Evolvable** without silent drift

If a document can change outcomes or decisions, its lifecycle must be explicit.

---

## 2) Lifecycle States (choose exactly one)

### DRAFT
**Meaning:** Work in progress; not authoritative  
**Rules:**
- Must be labelled `Status: Draft`
- Must not be referenced as canonical truth
- Can change freely

### CANONICAL
**Meaning:** Current source of truth; relied on by teams  
**Rules:**
- Must be labelled `Status: Canonical`
- Must name an Owner (role)
- Must be listed in `SPECS_INDEX.md`
- Changes require owner approval (and Head of Specs review if cross-domain)

### DEPRECATED
**Meaning:** Historically accurate, but no longer active truth  
**Rules:**
- Must be labelled `Status: Deprecated`
- Must include `Superseded By:` and `Effective From:`
- No edits except correcting references/metadata

### ARCHIVED
**Meaning:** Not relevant; retained only for audit/history  
**Rules:**
- Must be labelled `Status: Archived`
- Must not be edited or referenced by active specs

---

## 3) Versioning (documentation-only)

Use versioning when a change could alter interpretation.

**Format (if used):**
- `Version: MAJOR.MINOR`
  - **MAJOR** = meaning/behavior change (semantic shift)
  - **MINOR** = additive or clarifying (no semantic change)

**No version bump needed for:**
- spelling/grammar
- formatting
- rewording with identical meaning

---

## 4) Change Rules (who approves)

- **Draft:** anyone can edit
- **Canonical:** domain owner must approve
- **Cross-domain Canonical change:** domain owner + Head of Specs Team review
- **Deprecated/Archived:** no edits (except metadata links for Deprecated)

---

## 5) Mandatory Header Block (paste into docs)

```text
**Status:** Canonical|Draft|Deprecated|Archived
**Owner:** <role name>
**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Version:** MAJOR.MINOR (optional)
**Superseded By:** <doc> (Deprecated only)
**Effective From:** <date/version> (Deprecated only)
