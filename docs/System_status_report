## 📊 Performance Analysis

### Fast Endpoints (< 700ms)
All database-only endpoints perform excellently:
- Settings, trades, cash, signals: 500-650ms
- Root and health: 250-300ms

### Slower Endpoints (1-5s) - **EXPECTED**
These endpoints make external API calls to Yahoo Finance:

**GET /positions (3.6s):**
- Fetches live prices for all open positions
- Multiple Yahoo Finance API calls
- Rate limiting delays (300ms between calls)
- **This is by design** to prevent IP bans

**GET /portfolio (4.4s):**
- Fetches live prices for all positions
- Comprehensive portfolio calculation
- Same Yahoo Finance rate limiting

**GET /market/status (1.5s):**
- Fetches SPY price + 200-day MA
- Fetches FTSE price + 200-day MA
- Fetches live GBP/USD FX rate
- **Total: 3 external API calls**

### ⚡ Potential Optimizations (Optional)

**Cache Implementation (Not Required, Just Optional):**
- Add 5-minute cache for live prices
- Would reduce /positions from 3.6s → ~500ms
- Trade-off: Slightly stale prices vs speed
- **Recommendation:** Leave as-is for MVP, prices are more important than speed
