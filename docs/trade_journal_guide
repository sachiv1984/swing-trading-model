## Filtering by Tags

### Using Tag Filter in Trade History

1. **Go to Trade History page**
2. **Tag dropdown appears** (if you have tagged trades)
3. **Click dropdown** → See all available tags
4. **Select one or more tags** → Filter applies automatically
5. **Selected tags shown as pills** → Click X to remove

**How Filtering Works:**
- **OR logic** - Shows trades matching ANY selected tag
- **Example:** Select `momentum` + `breakout` → Shows trades with either tag
- **Combine with other filters** - Market, Date Range, Win/Loss still work

**Use Cases:**
- "Show me all my `earnings-play` trades"
- "Find all `stopped-out` trades to review mistakes"
- "Compare `momentum` vs `mean-reversion` win rates"

## Best Practices

### 📝 Entry Notes Best Practices

**✅ DO:**
- Document your hypothesis/thesis
- Note key technical levels (support/resistance)
- Record your stop loss plan
- Mention market context (SPY, sector)
- Keep it factual and objective

**❌ DON'T:**
- Write a novel (keep under 500 chars)
- Skip entries because you're "sure"
- Wait until later (memory fades)
- Focus only on why you'll win
- Ignore the downside scenario

**Template:**
```
Setup: [What you see]
Catalyst: [Why now]
Risk: [Stop level and %]
Target: [Profit goal]
Context: [Market regime]
```

### 📕 Exit Notes Best Practices

**✅ DO:**
- Be honest about mistakes
- Note what you'd do differently
- Record emotional state
- Celebrate good execution
- Learn from both wins and losses

**❌ DON'T:**
- Blame external factors only
- Skip exits because you're embarrassed
- Focus only on P&L
- Ignore process quality
- Make excuses

**Template:**
```
Exit: [Why/How]
Plan: [Did I follow it?]
Lesson: [What I learned]
Emotion: [How I felt]
Next time: [What I'll change]
```

### 🏷️ Tagging Best Practices

**✅ DO:**
- Tag immediately when entering
- Use consistent tag names
- Limit to 2-5 tags per trade
- Create tags for patterns you want to track
- Review tag list monthly and consolidate

**❌ DON'T:**
- Over-tag (10+ tags is too many)
- Create one-off tags
- Mix categories (strategy + outcome)
- Use tags as notes (that's what notes are for)
- Change tag names mid-year (breaks continuity)

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: New Momentum Trade

**Step 1 - Entry (Day 0):**
```
Position: NVDA, 10 shares @ $850
Entry Note: "Breaking out of 3-week consolidation on earnings beat. 
            Volume 2x average. Stop at $820 (-3.5%). Target $920."
Tags: momentum, earnings-play, breakout
```

**Step 2 - Monitoring (Days 1-15):**
- Check position daily in Positions page
- Can add to entry note if situation changes

**Step 3 - Exit (Day 12):**
```
Exit: $912 (+7.3%)
Exit Note: "Hit near target, profit-taking into resistance. 
           Great risk/reward. Execution followed plan perfectly. 
           Confident entry, patient hold."
```

**Step 4 - Review (End of Month):**
- Go to Trade History
- Filter by `momentum` + `earnings-play`

### Workflow 2: Learning from a Loss

**The Loss:**
```
Position: TSLA, 15 shares @ $245
Entry Note: "Oversold bounce attempt at support. 
            RSI <30. Stop at $230."
Tags: mean-reversion, oversold-bounce

Exit: $228 (-6.9%)
Exit Note: "Stopped out. Support failed - was a bear flag not 
           consolidation. Ignored downtrend. Rushed entry without 
           confirming volume. Lesson: Wait for reversal confirmation."
Tags: loser, stopped-out
```

**The Review (Week Later):**
1. Go to Trade History
2. Filter by `loser` tag
3. Expand all losing trades
4. **Look for patterns:**
   - "Am I rushing mean-reversion entries?"

   - Add to trading checklist

---

2. **Set date range:** Last month

   - Note: What did these have in common?
   
4. **Review losers:**
   - Filter by `loser` tag
   - Expand all losing trades
   - Note: What patterns led to losses?

5. **Tag analysis:**
   - Filter by each strategy tag
   - Compare win rates:
     - `momentum`: 65% win rate (keep doing!)
     - `mean-reversion`: 40% win rate (reduce size or stop)
     
6. **Update trading plan:**
   - Double down on what works
   - Eliminate what doesn't

## Advanced: Tag-Based Performance Analysis

### Strategy Win Rate Comparison

**Goal:** Find your highest win-rate strategy

**Method:**

3. **Compare:**
   ```
   Momentum: 12 trades, 8 wins = 67% win rate
   Mean-reversion: 8 trades, 3 wins = 37% win rate
   Breakout: 6 trades, 4 wins = 67% win rate
   ```
4. **Decision:** Focus on momentum & breakouts, reduce mean-reversion

### Setup Success Tracking
