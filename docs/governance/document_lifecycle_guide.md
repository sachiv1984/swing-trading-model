## 1. Purpose

This guide defines how all product documentation is:
- Classified
- Created
- Maintained
- Reviewed
- Versioned
- Deprecated or archived
- Enforced for compliance

Its goal is to prevent:
- Silent drift between documents and reality
- Conflicting sources of truth
- Undocumented behavioural change
- Documents that influence decisions without a named owner

**This guide applies to every document in the repository** — not only specs. All roles that own documentation are bound by it, regardless of which function they report into.

---

## 2. Document Classes

Every governed document belongs to exactly one class. The class determines which header fields are required, which lifecycle states are valid, and how compliance is checked.

---

### Class 1 — Canonical

**What it is:** The authoritative source of truth for a product domain. When this document and any other document disagree, this document prevails.

**Who creates it:** A named domain owner.

**Lifecycle states available:** Draft → Canonical → Deprecated → Archived

**Required header fields:**
```
Owner:        [Role name]
Status:       Canonical
Version:      [x.y]
Last Updated: [date]
```

**Rules:**
- Must be listed in the Specs Index
- Must not be contradicted by any Supporting document
- Changes that alter meaning, behaviour, or consumer interpretation require a version increment
- Deprecation requires an explicit successor declaration and effective date

**Examples:** `strategy_rules.md`, `data_model.md`, `metrics_definitions.md`, `api_contracts/*_endpoints.md`, `frontend/pages/*.md`, `document_lifecycle_guide.md` (this document)

---

### Class 2 — Supporting

**What it is:** A document that represents or summarises canonical truth. It adds no new rules. It must never contradict a Canonical document.

**Who creates it:** The domain owner of the canonical document it supports, or a designated maintainer.

**Lifecycle states available:** Current → Deprecated → Archived (no "Canonical" status — it derives authority from its source)

**Required header fields:**
```
Owner:          [Role name]
Status:         Supporting
Canonical Source: [path to canonical document]
Last Updated:   [date]
```

**Rules:**
- Must be reviewed inline with its canonical source whenever the canonical source changes
- Must declare which canonical document it represents
- A Supporting document becoming inconsistent with its canonical source is a system bug

**Examples:** `docs/reference/openapi.yaml`, diagrams, generated references

---

### Class 3 — Operational Record

**What it is:** A point-in-time record of observed system state. It records facts — it does not define rules or intended behaviour.

**Who creates it:** Infrastructure & Operations Documentation Owner (governs and files); engineering team (generates the underlying data).

**Lifecycle states available:** Filed (permanent — Operational Records are never deprecated or superseded)

**Required header fields:**
```
Owner:              Infrastructure & Operations Documentation Owner
Status:             Operational Record
Deployment Version: [version]
Report Date:        [date]
Environment:        [e.g. Production]
Generated By:       [system or person]
Filed:              [date filed]
```

**Rules:**
- Body content is immutable after filing — it records observed state at a fixed moment
- A newer record does not supersede an older one — both remain permanent artefacts
- Deviations from canonical specs observed in a record must be raised to the relevant domain owner; they are not resolved by annotating the record
- Naming convention: `System_status_report_v{version}_{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`
- Location: `docs/operations/status_reports/`

**Examples:** `System_status_report_v1.4_2026-02-14.md`

---

### Class 4 — Planning Document

**What it is:** A working document capturing product decisions, feature intent, prioritisation, and backlog thinking. It is pre-canonical — when a feature is built, the planning document is superseded by the canonical specs written for that feature.

Planning Documents include two distinct sub-types:

- **Roadmap, backlog, and decisions documents** — ongoing planning artifacts that evolve over time
- **Scope documents** — implementation briefs written at the end of the pre-alignment phase for a specific feature, immediately before engineering begins

**Who creates it:** Product Owner.

**Lifecycle states available:** Draft → Active → Superseded → Archived

**Required header fields:**
```
Owner:        Product Owner
Class:        Planning Document (Class 4)
Status:       [Draft | Active | Superseded]
Last Updated: [date]
```

**Rules:**
- Must carry a standing notice that all implementation detail is indicative and subject to canonical spec review before any code is written
- When a feature moves from planning to implementation, the planning document status is updated to Superseded and must reference the canonical documents that replace it
- Planning documents must never be cited as canonical intent — they record thinking, not decisions
- Implementation detail in planning documents (SQL schemas, endpoint paths, formulas) is illustrative; the canonical spec takes precedence if they conflict

**Scope document additional rules:**
- A scope document must not be written until QA review (acceptance criteria confirmation) is complete
- A scope document is the final gate before implementation is opened — it represents the Product Owner's sign-off that all pre-alignment work is done
- When the feature ships, the scope document status is updated to Superseded and must reference the changelog entry for the delivered version
- Scope documents must include a pre-implementation checklist confirming all canonical specs are locked

**Locations:**
- Roadmap and backlog: `docs/product/roadmap.md`, `docs/product/backlog.md`
- Decisions records: `docs/product/decisions/`
- Scope documents: `docs/product/scope/`

**Naming conventions:**
- Decisions records: `{roadmap-item-id}-{feature-slug}.md` (e.g. `3.2-position-sizing-calculator.md`)
- Scope documents: `scope--{roadmap-item-id}-{feature-slug}.md` (e.g. `scope--3.2-position-sizing-calculator.md`)

**Examples:** `docs/product/roadmap.md`, `docs/product/backlog.md`, `docs/product/decisions/3.2-position-sizing-calculator.md`, `docs/product/scope/scope--3.2-position-sizing-calculator.md`

---

### Class 5 — Role Charter

**What it is:** A document defining the scope, responsibilities, and operating standards of a named role in the documentation or engineering system.

**Who creates it:** Head of Specs Team (for Specs Team roles) or the role's functional lead (for Engineering roles). All charters are stored in `docs/documentation_team/specs/`.

**Lifecycle states available:** Draft → Canonical → Deprecated

**Required header fields:**
```
Owner:        Head of Specs Team [or functional lead]
Status:       Canonical
Version:      [x.y]
Last Updated: [date]
```

**Rules:**
- Every role that owns documents must have a charter
- Every charter must include a "Lifecycle & Versioning Compliance" section explicitly stating that the role owner is accountable for compliance of all documents they own
- Every charter must declare who the role reports to
- Charters are versioned when role scope or reporting line changes
- A role without a charter may not be treated as authoritative — their documents are Draft until a charter exists

**Examples:** `Head_of_Specs_Team.md`, `API_Contracts_&_Documentation_Owner.md`, `Infrastructure_and_Operations_Owner.md`

---

### Class 6 — Governance Prompt

**What it is:** An instruction set used to invoke automated compliance checking against this lifecycle guide. It is part of the governance infrastructure, not a product document.

**Who creates it:** Head of Specs Team.

**Lifecycle states available:** Draft → Active → Deprecated

**Required header fields:**
```
Owner:        Head of Specs Team
Status:       Active
Version:      [x.y]
Last Updated: [date]
```

**Rules:**
- Must reference this lifecycle guide by version
- Must be updated whenever a new document class is added or header requirements change
- Must cover all document classes, not only Canonical documents
- Location: `docs/documentation_team/prompts/`

**Examples:** `governance_reviewer.md`

---

## 3. Lifecycle States

### Universal states (available to all classes unless restricted above)

| State | Meaning | Who sets it |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Draft** | In progress, not authoritative | Document owner |
| **Canonical** | Authoritative source of truth | Document owner, confirmed by Head of Specs Team |
| **Active** | In use and current (for non-canonical classes) | Document owner |
| **Filed** | Permanently recorded (Operational Records only) | Ops Documentation Owner |
| **Superseded** | Replaced by canonical documents (Planning only) | Product Owner |
| **Deprecated** | No longer authoritative; successor declared | Document owner |
| **Archived** | Historical only; no longer referenced | Head of Specs Team |

**Rules that apply to all classes:**
- Every governed document must be in exactly one state at all times
- State must be declared explicitly in the document header
- No document may move from Deprecated or Archived back to an active state — a new document must be created instead
- Deprecation requires: what supersedes it, and from what date

---

## 4. Universal Header Block

Every governed document must carry a header block. The exact fields depend on document class (see Section 2), but the following fields are **required for all classes** except Operational Record (which has its own fixed set):

- **Owner** — the named role accountable for this document
- **Status** — one of the lifecycle states defined in Section 3
- **Last Updated** — the date the document was last meaningfully changed

Canonical documents and Role Charters additionally require:
- **Version** — incremented according to the versioning rules in Section 5

A document without a complete header block is non-compliant and must not be treated as authoritative regardless of its content.

---

## 5. Versioning Rules

Versioning applies to Canonical documents, Role Charters, and Governance Prompts.

**A version increment is required when:**
- Meaning changes
- Behaviour or rules change
- A consumer reading the document would act differently as a result

**A version increment is not required for:**
- Typo corrections
- Formatting changes
- Pure clarification that adds no new meaning

**Version format:** `x.y` where `x` (major) increments on breaking or significant behavioural changes, and `y` (minor) increments on additive or clarifying changes.

---

## 6. Mandatory Inline Review for Supporting Artifacts

When a change affects a Canonical document:

- Any Supporting document that represents that domain must be reviewed inline in the same change
- Approval must only be granted once alignment is confirmed

This applies explicitly to:
- API contracts ↔ `docs/reference/openapi.yaml`

If a change is explicitly declared "no contract change" and affects only internal implementation, Supporting artifact review is not required. Disputes are escalated to the Head of Specs Team.

---

## 7. Ownership & Accountability

**Every document must have a named owner.** A document without an owner is non-compliant.

**Domain owners are responsible for:**
- Accuracy of their documents
- Keeping documents current when the system they describe changes
- Ensuring Supporting documents remain aligned with their Canonical sources
- Initiating deprecation when a document is superseded

**The Head of Specs Team is responsible for:**
- Enforcing lifecycle compliance across all document classes
- Blocking changes when lifecycle rules are violated
- Resolving ambiguity about document class or ownership
- Maintaining and updating this guide
- Conducting or triggering compliance audits

**The Head of Specs Team has authority to audit any document in the repository** regardless of which function its owner reports into. Lifecycle compliance is a cross-functional standard, not a Specs Team internal rule.

---

## 8. Enforcement Mechanism

### When compliance is checked

Governance review must be triggered at the following points:

| Trigger | What is reviewed | Who triggers it |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| New document created | Header completeness, correct class assignment, owner named | Document owner (self-check), Head of Specs Team (on merge) |
| Existing document updated | Version increment if required, header currency | Document owner (self-check), Head of Specs Team (on merge) |
| Feature shipped | Planning documents for that feature updated to Superseded; canonical specs confirmed as filed | Head of Specs Team |
| New role created | Charter exists and is compliant before role is treated as authoritative | Head of Specs Team |
| Periodic audit | All documents checked for compliance | Head of Specs Team (quarterly recommended) |
| Governance guide updated | Governance reviewer prompt updated in same change | Head of Specs Team |

### How compliance is checked

The governance reviewer prompt (`docs/documentation_team/prompts/governance_reviewer.md`) is the primary compliance tool. It must be invoked using the prompt as a system instruction with the document(s) under review provided as context.

Automated review assists but does not replace owner accountability.

### What happens when compliance fails

| Severity | Condition | Consequence |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Blocking** | Missing owner, missing status, Canonical document with no version | Document must not be merged or treated as authoritative until remediated |
| **Required** | Incorrect lifecycle state, version not incremented when required, Supporting artifact not reviewed inline | Must be remediated before the change is considered complete |
| **Advisory** | Minor header formatting inconsistency, Last Updated date stale | Should be remediated; does not block |

---

## 9. Roles Outside the Specs Team

This guide applies to **all roles that own documents**, including those outside the Specs Team. Specifically:

- **Product Owner** — Planning Documents must follow Class 4 rules
- **Engineering Lead** — any documentation owned by the engineering function must follow this guide
- **Infrastructure & Operations Documentation Owner** — Operational Records and Operational Guides must follow Class 3 and Class 1 rules respectively
- **QA & Testing Owner** — testing documentation must follow this guide

The Head of Specs Team sets these standards. Roles outside the Specs Team follow them. This is a standards relationship, not a management relationship — the Head of Specs Team does not manage those roles but does have authority to flag non-compliance to their functional lead.

---

## 10. Non-Negotiable Rule

> If a document influences decisions,
> it must be owned, reviewed, and aligned at the point of change.
