## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **authoritative production trading strategy** for the Momentum Trading System.

It serves as a **behavioral contract** between:
- Strategy intent
- System implementation
- Backtests and reported performance

If behavior affects trading outcomes, it is specified here. This document overrides interpretations derived from code, UI, or analytics.

## 2. Strategy Intent (Non‑Negotiable)

The strategy is designed to:

1. Capture **medium‑ to long‑term momentum trends**
2. Avoid premature exits caused by early volatility
3. Allow losing trades sufficient room to resolve
4. Protect profits aggressively once momentum is confirmed
5. Enforce asymmetric risk: **losses are tolerated, gains are defended**

These principles define *what the strategy is trying to achieve*. They are stable over time.

## 3. Human‑in‑the‑Loop Execution Model

- Entries and exits are **manually executed** by the user
- All exits generated by the system are **recommendations**, not automatic orders
- The system’s responsibility is **decision support**, not trade execution

This constraint is intentional and part of the strategy design.

- Required at entry:
