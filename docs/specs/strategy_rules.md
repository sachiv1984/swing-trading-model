## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **authoritative production trading strategy** for the Momentum Trading System.

It serves as a **behavioral contract** between:
- Strategy intent
- System implementation
- Backtests and reported performance

If behavior affects trading outcomes, it is specified here. This document overrides interpretations derived from code, UI, or analytics.

---

## 2. Strategy Intent (Non‑Negotiable)

The strategy is designed to:

1. Capture **medium‑ to long‑term momentum trends**
2. Avoid premature exits caused by early volatility
3. Allow losing trades sufficient room to resolve
4. Protect profits aggressively once momentum is confirmed
5. Enforce asymmetric risk: **losses are tolerated, gains are defended**

These principles define *what the strategy is trying to achieve*. They are stable over time.

---

## 3. Human‑in‑the‑Loop Execution Model

- Entries and exits are **manually executed** by the user
- All exits generated by the system are **recommendations**, not automatic orders
- The system's responsibility is **decision support**, not trade execution

This constraint is intentional and part of the strategy design.

---

## 4. Position Entry Rules

- Positions are entered manually via the web interface
- Required at entry:
  - Ticker symbol
  - Entry date
  - Entry price
  - Number of shares (fractional supported)
  - ATR value (used for stop calculation)

Fees are applied automatically based on market (UK / US).

---

## 5. Initial Stop Calculation

At the moment of entry, an initial protective stop is calculated:
```
Initial Stop = Entry Price − (Initial ATR Multiplier × ATR)
```

- The stop **exists immediately**
- The stop is **stored and tracked** from day one
- The stop is **not enforced** during the grace period

Purpose:
- Provide downside awareness
- Anchor future trailing logic
- Avoid reactive decision‑making

---

## 6. Grace Period

### Definition

A fixed grace period is applied to all new positions.

### Current Production Configuration

- **Grace Period Length:** 10 calendar days (days 0–9 inclusive)

### Behavior During Grace Period

- Stop‑loss enforcement is disabled
- Stop price is calculated and stored
- No automatic exit may occur due to stop logic
- Manual exit is always permitted

### Strategic Rationale

The grace period exists to prevent exits driven by **normal post‑entry volatility**, not by invalidation of the trade thesis.

---

## 7. Trailing Stop‑Loss Framework (Post‑Grace)

Once the grace period ends, the position enters active risk management.

### ATR Framework

- ATR Period: 14 days (rolling)
- ATR is recalculated daily

### Profit‑Aware Stop Logic

The system applies **different stop widths depending on profitability**.

#### Losing or Breakeven Positions
```
Stop = Current Price − (Initial ATR Multiplier × ATR)
```

- Wide stop
- Designed to allow recovery
- Avoids noise‑driven exits

#### Profitable Positions
```
Stop = Current Price − (Profit ATR Multiplier × ATR)
```

- Tight trailing stop
- Locks in gains
- Reduces drawdowns from winners

### Stop Movement Rule (Hard Constraint)
```
Updated Stop = max(Current Stop, Newly Calculated Stop)
```

- Stops **never move downwards**
- Once tightened, a stop is never loosened

This rule is absolute.

---

## 8. Exit Conditions

A position may exit under **exactly three conditions**:

### 1. Stop‑Loss Trigger

- Only active after the grace period
- Triggered when market price breaches the trailing stop
- Exit is recommended and requires manual confirmation

### 2. Market Risk‑Off Override

- Positions are exited when the relevant market enters a risk‑off regime
- Regime is defined by the 200‑day moving average of the relevant index
- Applies regardless of stop position

### 3. Manual Exit

- User‑initiated
- Available at any time

---

## 9. Position States

Each position exists in exactly one state at any time:

- **GRACE:** Days 0–9, stop inactive
- **LOSING:** Post‑grace, P&L ≤ 0, wide stop
- **PROFITABLE:** Post‑grace, P&L > 0, tight stop
- **EXITED:** Position closed

States are mutually exclusive and deterministic.

---

## 10. Risk Management Summary

### Position‑Level

- Fixed grace period
- Wide stops while losing
- Tight stops once profitable
- Stops only tighten

### Portfolio‑Level

- Market regime override
- Currency‑aware P&L
- Cash‑flow‑adjusted performance tracking

---

## 11. Current Production Parameters

The following parameters define the **current production configuration**:

- **Grace Period:** 10 days
- **Initial / Losing Stop Multiplier:** 5 × ATR
- **Profitable Stop Multiplier:** 2 × ATR
- **ATR Period:** 14 days

These values are consistent across:
- Production backtests
- Live system logic
- Reported performance metrics

---

## 12. Parameter Governance (Critical Clarification)

The values listed above are **parameters**, not immutable rules.

They define **how the strategy currently expresses its intent**, not the intent itself.

### What Is Stable

- Existence of a grace period
- Asymmetric treatment of losses vs profits
- Profit‑locking behavior
- Non‑loosening stops

### What May Change in the Future

- Grace period length
- ATR multipliers
- ATR lookback period

### Change Control Requirements

Any parameter change must:

1. Be explicitly documented
2. Be versioned at the strategy level
3. State rationale and expected impact
4. Acknowledge loss of direct comparability with prior results
5. Be applied consistently across backtests, live logic, and documentation

Until such a versioned change is made, **10 days, 5× ATR, and 2× ATR define the canonical production behavior**.

## 13. System Boundaries

### This System Is

- A deterministic decision‑support engine
- A risk‑managed momentum framework
- A single, explicit, human‑designed momentum strategy
- Human‑in‑the‑loop by design

### This System Is Not

- An automated trading bot
- A broker execution engine
- A discretionary or adaptive rule system
- A multi‑strategy or configurable strategy platform
- A machine learning or AI‑driven prediction system
- An options or futures trading system
- A real‑time streaming or execution system

### Design Boundary Rationale

**Human‑in‑the‑loop execution is a design principle, not a limitation.**
All entries and exits are manually confirmed by the user. This deliberate review step is part of the strategy. Automated execution would remove it. Broker API integration is excluded for the same reason: user‑provided prices and FX rates sourced directly from broker statements are intentional. The system is not designed to be connected to a broker.

**Gap risk monitoring is excluded by design.**
The system operates on a daily decision cadence. Gap risk cannot be acted on within this model — by the time the user reviews the system, the gap has already occurred. Displaying a gap risk metric would present information the user cannot act on at the moment it matters. This creates noise without enabling a decision. The exclusion is a deliberate design choice, not a deferred feature.

**The strategy is fixed and explicit. Adaptability is not a goal.**
The system implements one human‑designed momentum strategy with defined, versioned parameters. A strategy builder, adaptive rules engine, or ML‑generated signals would fundamentally alter the nature of the system. Predictability, auditability, and human oversight would be compromised. These capabilities are not features to be added in a future version; they are outside the design intent of this system.

## 14. Authority Statement

This document is the **single source of truth** for production strategy behavior.

If a discrepancy exists between:
- Code
- UI behavior
- Analytics
- User interpretation

**This document prevails.**

## Guiding Principle

> If a rule can change outcomes,
> it must be **explicit, intentional, and owned**.
