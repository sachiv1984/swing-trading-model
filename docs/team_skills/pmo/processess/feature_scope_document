# Feature Scope Document

**Owner:** PMO Lead
**Type:** PMO Process Template
**Status:** Canonical
**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-19

---

## Purpose

This template is used by the Product Owner to produce the scope document for a feature once QA sign-off has been confirmed. The scope document is the final deliverable of the pre-alignment phase. It is the implementation brief handed to engineering.

The PMO Lead coordinates the production of the scope document and confirms it is compliant before declaring implementation open.

---

## When to Use

- Triggered when the QA Review Gate (Phase 3) passes
- Produced by the Product Owner
- Committed before implementation is declared open

---

## Required Inputs

Before writing the scope document, confirm all of the following are available:

- [ ] Decisions record committed at `docs/product/decisions/{id}-{slug}.md`
- [ ] All canonical spec updates committed and verified
- [ ] QA review verdict confirmed as Pass (or Conditional Pass fully resolved)
- [ ] Revised effort estimate (if scope changed during pre-alignment)

---

## Scope Document Template

The scope document is a Class 4 Planning Document. It must follow the header format defined in `docs/governance/document_lifecycle_guide.md`.

---

```markdown
# Scope Document — {Feature Name}

**Owner:** Product Owner
**Class:** Planning Document (Class 4)
**Status:** Active
**Last Updated:** {date}
**Roadmap item:** {item id}
**Target release:** {version}

> ⚠️ Standing Notice: This document describes delivery intent and summarises
> canonical spec decisions for the purposes of implementation. All authoritative
> rules, formulas, field definitions, and constraints live in the canonical
> specifications listed in Section 2. In any conflict between this document and
> those specs, the canonical specs prevail. This document must not be cited as
> canonical intent.

---

## 1. What This Is

{2–3 sentence plain-language description of the feature. What it does, who
uses it, and why it matters. No technical detail — that belongs in the specs.}

---

## 2. Canonical Specifications (Implementation Source of Truth)

Engineering must implement against these documents. This scope document
summarises; the specs govern.

| Spec | What it owns |
|------|--------------|
| {spec file} ({version}) | {what it owns for this feature} |
| {spec file} ({version}) | {what it owns for this feature} |

---

## 3. Scope

### 3.1 In scope

**Backend**
{Bullet list of backend work items — endpoint implementation, migrations,
settings changes, etc.}

**Frontend**
{Bullet list of frontend work items — component changes, page changes,
settings UI changes, etc.}

### 3.2 Out of scope

{Explicit list of things that were considered and excluded. Each item should
state the decision and where it was made (e.g. "Decision 3, decisions record").}

---

## 4. Calculation Summary (if applicable)

{For features involving business logic: a plain-language summary of the key
formulas. Canonical rules are in the spec — this is orientation only.}

---

## 5. API Endpoint(s)

{For each new or modified endpoint: method, path, and a one-line summary of
the three response shapes (if applicable). Full contract is in the API spec.}

---

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

Derived from {spec file(s)} per QA review ({date}).

**Backend**
{Bullet list of backend acceptance criteria — each one testable and
unambiguous.}

**Frontend**
{Bullet list of frontend acceptance criteria — each one testable and
unambiguous.}

---

## 7. Effort Estimate

{X–Y days.} {One sentence explaining the estimate and noting if it changed
during pre-alignment and why.}

---

## 8. Pre-Implementation Checklist

All items confirmed complete before this document was written:

- [ ] {Spec file} updated ({version})
- [ ] {Spec file} updated ({version})
- [ ] `openapi.yaml` updated ({version})
- [ ] Data model updated with migration ({version})
- [ ] QA review complete — acceptance criteria confirmed derivable ({date})

---

## 9. Out of Scope Confirmation

| Item | Decision |
|------|----------|
| {Item} | {Why excluded and where decided} |
```

---

## Compliance Check

Before committing the scope document, the PMO Lead confirms:

- [ ] Header block is complete (Owner, Class, Status, Last Updated, Roadmap item, Target release)
- [ ] Standing notice is present
- [ ] All canonical specs in Section 2 include version numbers
- [ ] Section 9 explicitly lists items that were considered and excluded
- [ ] Pre-implementation checklist is complete — no unchecked items
- [ ] File is committed to `docs/product/scope/scope--{id}-{slug}.md`
- [ ] File naming follows the convention: `scope--{roadmap-item-id}-{feature-slug}.md`

A scope document with unchecked items in the pre-implementation checklist must not be committed. It means pre-alignment is not complete.

---

## After Commitment

Once the scope document is committed:

- The PMO Lead notifies the Head of Engineering that implementation is open
- The PMO Lead schedules the lessons learnt review using `processes/lessons_learnt.md`
- The roadmap entry for the feature is updated to reference the scope document location
