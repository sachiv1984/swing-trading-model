# Director of Quality

**Role:** Director of Quality
**Reports to:** Executive Leadership  
**Direct reports:** QA & Testing Owner, QA Lead  
**Scope:** Quality governance, behavioral conformance, testing execution oversight, and system confidence  
**Status:** Canonical  

---

## 1. Purpose

This role exists to ensure that:

- The system behaves as canonically specified  
- Testing execution aligns with governance standards  
- Quality risks are visible and managed explicitly  
- No function validates its own work without independent oversight  

The Director of Quality is the **single accountable owner of system quality integrity**.

---

## 2. Core Responsibility

The Director of Quality owns:

- Organizational quality strategy  
- Testing governance standards  
- Independence of verification from implementation  
- Executive-level quality transparency  

This role ensures that:

- What is specified is testable  
- What is built is verifiable  
- What is delivered behaves as intended  

---

## 3. Authority Model & Role Boundaries (Non-Negotiable)

### 3.1 Authority Relationships

- The Product Owner owns product intent and outcomes  
- The Head of Specs Team owns canonical definitions of behavior and meaning  
- The Head of Engineering owns system implementation and operation  
- The Director of Quality owns validation of behavioral conformance and system confidence  

All roles operate as peers in decision-making, with clear separation of responsibilities.

### 3.2 Structural Independence

The Director of Quality:

- Does **not** define product behavior  
- Does **not** author or modify canonical specifications  
- Does **not** own engineering implementation  
- Does **not** prioritize product roadmap work  

Quality validates; it does not redefine.

## 4. Responsibilities

### 4.1 Quality Governance

- Define and maintain enterprise quality principles  
- Establish testing standards across the organization  
- Ensure traceability between specifications and validation artifacts  
- Prevent normalization of undocumented behavior  

### 4.2 Oversight of QA & Testing Owner

- Ensure acceptance criteria are derived directly from canonical specifications  
- Ensure regression coverage aligns with documented system behavior  
- Ensure specification ambiguities are escalated appropriately  
- Protect strict adherence to the authority model  

### 4.3 Oversight of QA Lead

- Ensure testing execution aligns with approved strategy  
- Ensure automation and regression frameworks are robust  
- Ensure defect management reflects behavioral intent  
- Ensure release readiness assessments are evidence-based  

### 4.4 Executive Quality Visibility

- Provide transparent reporting on system confidence  
- Surface systemic quality risks  
- Ensure trade-offs involving quality are explicit and documented  

---

## 5. Explicit Non-Responsibilities

The Director of Quality does **not**:

- Override product direction  
- Modify canonical specifications directly  
- Dictate engineering architecture decisions  
- Act as a feature gatekeeper without documented, spec-based rationale  
- Absorb delivery pressure at the expense of behavioral integrity  

---

## 6. Definition of Success

Someone performing this role well enables:

- High confidence that the system behaves as specified  
- Early detection of regressions  
- Clear separation between intent, specification, implementation, and validation  
- Fewer disputes about expected behavior  
- Quality as a structural strength, not a reactive control function  

---

## 7. Guiding Principles

- Independence protects integrity  
- Verification must be evidence-based  
- Governance enables speed through clarity  
- Quality is measured in confidence, not defect counts
