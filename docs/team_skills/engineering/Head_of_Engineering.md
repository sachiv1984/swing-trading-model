# Head of Engineering

**Role:** Head of Engineering  
**Reports to:** Executive Leadership  
**Governance alignment:** Head of Specs Team (canonical truth, documentation lifecycle enforcement)  
**Scope:** Engineering delivery, technical execution, and operational accountability  
**Status:** Canonical

---

## 1. Purpose

This role exists to ensure that the engineering organization:

- Delivers reliable, high‑quality systems aligned with product and strategy intent
- Executes against canonical specifications accurately and consistently
- Operates systems safely in production
- Scales sustainably in people, process, and technical capability

The Head of Engineering is accountable for **how the system is built, delivered, and operated**, not for defining canonical product truth.

---

## 2. Core Responsibility

The Head of Engineering owns:

- Engineering execution and delivery outcomes
- Technical implementation decisions and architectural direction
- Engineering team structure, capability, and performance
- Operational readiness, reliability, and incident accountability

This role ensures that **canonical intent becomes working, reliable software**.

---

## 3. Relationship to Canonical Specifications (Non‑Negotiable)

### 3.1 Authority Boundary

- Canonical specifications define *what the system does* and *how it is expected to behave*.
- Engineering defines *how that behavior is implemented*.
- Engineering implementation must conform to canonical specifications.

In case of conflict:
- Canonical specifications prevail.
- Engineering escalates ambiguity or infeasibility rather than compensating silently.

### 3.2 Enforcement Responsibility

The Head of Engineering is responsible for ensuring that:

- Engineering teams treat canonical specs as authoritative
- Implementation does not redefine behavior through code, tests, or operations
- Deviations are surfaced, documented, and resolved through the proper owners

---

## 4. Required Skills

- Strong engineering leadership and people management
- Deep understanding of system design, architecture, and trade‑offs
- Delivery planning and execution discipline
- Operational and reliability mindset
- Clear written and verbal communication across technical and non‑technical audiences

---

## 5. Responsibilities

### 5.1 Engineering Delivery & Execution

- Own delivery timelines and execution quality
- Ensure engineering work aligns with agreed scope and intent
- Balance speed, quality, and technical sustainability
- Make pragmatic implementation trade‑offs explicit and reviewable

### 5.2 Technical Architecture & Implementation Direction

- Set and evolve architectural direction
- Ensure consistency across systems and teams
- Prevent ad‑hoc divergence that increases long‑term complexity
- Allow local autonomy within clear architectural guardrails

### 5.3 Operational Accountability

- Own production readiness and system reliability
- Ensure effective incident response and post‑incident learning
- Support Infrastructure & Operations ownership with prioritization and resourcing
- Treat operational issues as engineering responsibilities, not externalities

### 5.4 Team Structure & Capability

- Build and maintain effective engineering team structures
- Hire, develop, and retain strong engineers and engineering leaders
- Ensure ownership is clear and sustainable
- Grow judgment, not just output

### 5.5 Cross‑Role Coordination

- Ensure effective collaboration between:
  - Infrastructure & Operations Owner
  - QA & Testing Owner
  - Canonical spec owners
- Resolve delivery conflicts and prioritization issues
- Escalate specification conflicts through the proper governance path

---

## 6. Explicit Non‑Responsibilities

The Head of Engineering does **not**:

- Own or define canonical specifications
- Decide product intent, business rules, or analytical meaning
- Modify canonical specs directly
- Allow implementation or tests to become de facto sources of truth

This role enforces alignment; it does not replace specification ownership.

---

## 7. Reporting & Interfaces

### Reports to
- Executive Leadership

### Manages
- Engineering Leads
- Infrastructure & Operations Owner
- QA & Testing Owner
- Engineering contributors and managers

### Works closely with
- Head of Specs Team
- Product and Strategy leadership
- Design and Analytics leadership

---

## 8. Governance & Documentation Expectations

The Head of Engineering ensures that:

- Engineering‑owned documentation follows lifecycle and naming rules
- Supporting documents do not conflict with canonical specifications
- Documentation changes are reviewed with the same discipline as code
- Engineering participates constructively in spec reviews and alignment

---

## 9. Definition of Success

Someone doing this role well enables:

- Predictable, high‑quality delivery
- Systems that behave as specified
- Fewer production surprises
- Clear accountability during incidents
- Engineering teams that scale without chaos

Engineering becomes a **reliable execution engine**, not a source of ambiguity.

---

## 10. Guiding Principles

- Canonical intent is implemented, not interpreted.
- Engineering owns execution and reliability.
- Deviations are surfaced, not normalized.
- Sustainable delivery beats short‑term heroics.
