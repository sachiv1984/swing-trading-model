## Current Status

```
Current state:    LOGGED
Next gate:        G1 — LOGGED → TRIAGED
Who acts next:    QA Lead (severity), Head of Specs Team (canonical spec),
                  Engineering (BLG-TECH-01 confirmation + co-delivery ack)
Blockers:         B-02 (severity), B-03 (canonical spec — THIS DEFECT),
                  B-04 (validation_system.md v1.0.2 action unconfirmed)
Escalation timer: STARTED — 2026-02-21T00:00:00Z
                  (timer runs against severity-tier SLA once severity is assigned)
```

## Co-Delivery Constraint

BLG-TECH-02 and BLG-TECH-03 are co-delivered per backlog and roadmap:

- BLG-TECH-03 AC states: *"Code touched once alongside BLG-TECH-02"*
- BLG-TECH-03 dependency states: *"Must be delivered alongside BLG-TECH-02"*

**Constraint (GI-5):** Neither defect may independently pass Gate G3 (Fix In Progress), G4 (Fix Validated), or G5 (Closed) unless a formal scope decision — validated by PMO Lead and recorded in both Phase Gate Documents — explicitly decouples them. Both documents are progressed in lock-step.

**Owner acknowledgement required:** Engineering must confirm this constraint in writing before G1 can pass (gate item G1.5). See Action A-04.

## Gate Register

### Gate G1 — LOGGED → TRIAGED

**Gate status: 🔴 CANNOT PASS — items outstanding**

---

#### G1.1 — BLG-TECH-01 prerequisite confirmed clear

```
Gate item:  BLG-TECH-01 signed off and v1.6 quality gate satisfied
            (Decision 7, BLG-TECH-01 decisions record: BLG-TECH-03 must
            not begin until BLG-TECH-01 is signed off and v1.6 gate cleared)

Evidence required:
  Written confirmation that BLG-TECH-01 is closed.
  Written confirmation that v1.6 quality gate is satisfied.

Satisfiability note:
  backlog.md records BLG-TECH-01 as "✅ COMPLETE — 2026-02-21"
  roadmap.md records "v1.6 quality gate satisfied"
  — Satisfiable subject to Engineering owner confirmation below.

Evidence:             ⬜ PENDING (source records available)
Owner confirmation:   ⬜ PENDING — Engineering, date required
PMO validation:       ⬜ PENDING
```

---

#### G1.2 — BLG-TECH-01 outstanding action confirmed (HARD BLOCK on G3)

```
Gate item:  "Apply validation_system.md v1.0.2 — expected value independence
            and coverage completeness rules"
            (BLG-TECH-01 lessons learnt outstanding actions —
            docs/team_skills/pmo/lessons_learnt/BLG-TECH-01.md)
            Trigger: "Before BLG-TECH-02 implementation begins"
            — applies transitively to BLG-TECH-03 via co-delivery constraint

This item does NOT block Gate G1 (triage may proceed).
It is a HARD BLOCK on Gate G3 (Fix In Progress).
It is pre-registered here for full auditability.

Evidence required:
  Written confirmation from Infrastructure & Operations Documentation
  Owner and Engineering that validation_system.md v1.0.2 rules have
  been applied. Reference to updated document version required.

Evidence:             🔴 MISSING
Owner confirmation:   🔴 MISSING — Infrastructure & Operations
                      Documentation Owner + Engineering, date required
PMO validation:       FAIL (pending evidence)

⚠️  G3 is hard-blocked until this item passes.
```

---

#### G1.3 — Severity assigned

```
Gate item:  Severity tier formally assigned per defect_lifecycle.md §2

Evidence required:
  Written severity classification: Critical / High / Medium / Low
  Assigned by: QA Lead (sole authority)
  Date of assignment

PMO note:
  Backlog priority P1 ≠ defect severity. The QA Lead makes an
  independent determination. PMO will not infer severity from
  backlog priority. (GI-3)

Evidence:             Severity: Medium — architectural deviation, validation logic
                      split between router and service stub; no canonical
                      behaviour currently incorrect; risk of future duplication
                      but no present correctness failure
Owner confirmation:   Yes — QA Lead, 2026-02-21
PMO validation:       Pass — PMO Lead, 2026-02-21
```

---

#### G1.4 — Canonical specification confirmed as implementation authority

```
Gate item:  Named canonical specification confirmed as the sole
            implementation authority for BLG-TECH-03 service layer scope

Evidence required:
  Head of Specs Team identifies and confirms in writing the canonical
  spec governing:
    - Service layer structure
    - Validation consolidation (no validation logic in router)
  Named spec document + version required.

⚠️  This is a BLOCKING gap specific to BLG-TECH-03.
  BLG-TECH-02 has a confirmed canonical spec (analytics_endpoints.md v1.8.1).
  BLG-TECH-03 does not. The PMO Lead cannot infer a canonical owner.
  The Head of Specs Team must resolve this before G1 can pass for this defect.

Evidence:             🔴 MISSING
Owner confirmation:   🔴 MISSING — Head of Specs Team, date required
PMO validation:       FAIL (pending evidence)
```

---

#### G1.5 — Co-delivery constraint acknowledged

```
Gate item:  Co-delivery constraint between BLG-TECH-02 and BLG-TECH-03
            formally acknowledged by Engineering in writing in this document

Evidence required:
  Written acknowledgement from Engineering owner of this constraint
  (recorded in this document and mirrored in BLG-TECH-02 Phase Gate Document)

Evidence:             🔴 MISSING
Owner confirmation:   🔴 MISSING — Engineering, date required
PMO validation:       ⬜ PENDING
```
