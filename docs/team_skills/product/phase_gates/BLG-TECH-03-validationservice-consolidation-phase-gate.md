## Current Status

```
Current state:    TRIAGED
Next gate:        G2 — TRIAGED → ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
Who acts next:    Engineering
Blockers:         None
Escalation timer: RUNNING — 2026-02-21T00:00:00Z (Medium severity SLA)
```

## Co-Delivery Constraint

BLG-TECH-02 and BLG-TECH-03 are co-delivered per backlog and roadmap:

- BLG-TECH-03 AC states: *"Code touched once alongside BLG-TECH-02"*
- BLG-TECH-03 dependency states: *"Must be delivered alongside BLG-TECH-02"*

**Constraint (GI-5):** Neither defect may independently pass Gate G3 (Fix In Progress), G4 (Fix Validated), or G5 (Closed) unless a formal scope decision — validated by PMO Lead and recorded in both Phase Gate Documents — explicitly decouples them. Both documents are progressed in lock-step.

**Owner acknowledgement required:** Engineering must confirm this constraint in writing before G1 can pass (gate item G1.5). See Action A-04.

---

## Gate Register

### Gate G1 — LOGGED → TRIAGED

**Gate status: ✅ ALL G1 ITEMS PASS — state transition to TRIAGED pending co-delivery lock-step confirmation with BLG-TECH-02**

---

#### G1.1 — BLG-TECH-01 prerequisite confirmed clear

```
Gate item:  BLG-TECH-01 signed off and v1.6 quality gate satisfied
            (Decision 7, BLG-TECH-01 decisions record: BLG-TECH-03 must
            not begin until BLG-TECH-01 is signed off and v1.6 gate cleared)

Evidence required:
  Written confirmation that BLG-TECH-01 is closed.
  Written confirmation that v1.6 quality gate is satisfied.

Satisfiability note:
  backlog.md records BLG-TECH-01 as "✅ COMPLETE — 2026-02-21"
  roadmap.md records "v1.6 quality gate satisfied"
  — Satisfiable subject to Engineering owner confirmation below.

Evidence:             backlog.md — BLG-TECH-01 status: ✅ COMPLETE 2026-02-21;
                      roadmap.md — "v1.6 quality gate satisfied"
Owner confirmation:   Yes — Head of Engineering, 2026-02-21
PMO validation:       Pass — PMO Lead, 2026-02-21
```

---

#### G1.2 — BLG-TECH-01 outstanding action confirmed (HARD BLOCK on G3)

```
Gate item:  "Apply validation_system.md v1.0.2 — expected value independence
            and coverage completeness rules"
            (BLG-TECH-01 lessons learnt outstanding actions —
            docs/team_skills/pmo/lessons_learnt/BLG-TECH-01.md)
            Trigger: "Before BLG-TECH-02 implementation begins"
            — applies transitively to BLG-TECH-03 via co-delivery constraint

This item does NOT block Gate G1 (triage may proceed).
It is a HARD BLOCK on Gate G3 (Fix In Progress).
It is pre-registered here for full auditability.

Evidence required:
  Written confirmation from Infrastructure & Operations Documentation
  Owner and Engineering that validation_system.md v1.0.2 rules have
  been applied. Reference to updated document version required.

Evidence:             docs/operations/validation_system.md v1.0.2
                      Rule 1 added: expected value independence — values must
                      be independently hand-calculated from metrics_definitions.md,
                      never derived by running the implementation.
                      Rule 2 added: coverage completeness — every metric in
                      GET /analytics/metrics must have a EXPECTED_METRICS entry;
                      omission is a governance violation.
Owner confirmation:   Yes — Infrastructure & Operations Documentation Owner
                      + Engineering, 2026-02-21
PMO validation:       Pass — PMO Lead, 2026-02-21
```

---

#### G1.3 — Severity assigned

```
Gate item:  Severity tier formally assigned per defect_lifecycle.md §2

Evidence required:
  Written severity classification: Critical / High / Medium / Low
  Assigned by: QA Lead (sole authority)
  Date of assignment

PMO note:
  Backlog priority P1 ≠ defect severity. The QA Lead makes an
  independent determination. PMO will not infer severity from
  backlog priority. (GI-3)

Evidence:             Severity: Medium — architectural deviation, validation logic
                      split between router and service stub; no canonical
                      behaviour currently incorrect; risk of future duplication
                      but no present correctness failure
Owner confirmation:   Yes — QA Lead, 2026-02-21
PMO validation:       Pass — PMO Lead, 2026-02-21
```

---

#### G1.4 — Canonical specification confirmed as implementation authority

```
Gate item:  Named canonical specification confirmed as the sole
            implementation authority for BLG-TECH-03 service layer scope

Evidence required:
  Head of Specs Team identifies and confirms in writing the canonical
  spec governing:
    - Service layer structure
    - Validation consolidation (no validation logic in router)
  Named spec document + version required.

Evidence:             docs/team_skills/engineering/backend_engineering_patterns.md
                      (Status: Canonical) — §3 non-negotiable rules:
                      "Routers must be thin. No business logic in a router."
                      "Services contain all business logic."
                      Secondary ref: analytics_endpoints.md v1.8.1 known
                      limitations confirms the deviation is tracked as BLG-TECH-03.
                      Compliance note raised: backend_engineering_patterns.md
                      carries no version number — non-compliant with
                      document_lifecycle_guide.md §2 Class 1; separate
                      governance action raised by Head of Specs Team.
Owner confirmation:   Yes — Head of Specs Team, 2026-02-21
PMO validation:       Pass — PMO Lead, 2026-02-21
```

---

#### G1.5 — Co-delivery constraint acknowledged

```
Gate item:  Co-delivery constraint between BLG-TECH-02 and BLG-TECH-03
            formally acknowledged by Engineering in writing in this document

Evidence required:
  Written acknowledgement from Engineering owner of this constraint
  (recorded in this document and mirrored in BLG-TECH-02 Phase Gate Document)

Evidence:             Written confirmation: BLG-TECH-02 and BLG-TECH-03 to be
                      progressed in lock-step; neither will enter Fix In Progress,
                      Fix Validated, or Closed independently without formal
                      PMO-validated scope decision
Owner confirmation:   Yes — Head of Engineering, 2026-02-21
PMO validation:       Pass — PMO Lead, 2026-02-21
```
