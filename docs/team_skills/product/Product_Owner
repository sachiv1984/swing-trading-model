# Product Owner

**Role:** Product Owner  
**Reports to:** Executive Leadership  
**Direct reports:** Head of Engineering, Head of Specs Team, Head of UX & Design
**Scope:** Product intent, prioritization, and outcome accountability  
**Status:** Canonical

---

## 1. Purpose

This role exists to ensure that the product:

- Solves the right problems
- Delivers clear and intentional value
- Evolves coherently over time
- Aligns strategy, specifications, and engineering execution

The Product Owner is the **single accountable owner of product intent and outcomes**.

---

## 2. Core Responsibility

The Product Owner owns:

- Product vision and strategic direction
- Prioritization of product work and trade‑offs
- Definition of success and outcome measurement
- Alignment between specification intent and engineering delivery

This role ensures that **the right things are specified** and **the right things are built**.

---

## 3. Authority Model & Role Boundaries (Non‑Negotiable)

### 3.1 Authority Relationships

- The Product Owner owns **what the product is meant to achieve** and **why**.
- The Head of Specs owns **canonical product truth** (formal definitions of behavior and meaning).
- The Head of Engineering owns **how the system is built and operated**.

All three roles are peers in decision‑making, but the Product Owner is the **tie‑breaker on product direction and prioritization**.

---

## 4. Relationship to Canonical Specifications

The Product Owner:

- Sets product intent and priorities that drive specification work
- Does **not** author or directly modify canonical specifications
- Relies on the Head of Specs Team to formalize intent into canonical documents
- Ensures that specifications reflect real product decisions, not assumptions

If product intent changes, the Product Owner ensures that:
- The change is explicit
- The relevant spec owners are engaged
- The impact is understood before delivery proceeds

---

## 5. Relationship to Engineering Execution

The Product Owner:

- Prioritizes engineering work based on product value and risk
- Makes scope and sequencing trade‑offs explicit
- Accepts or rejects outcomes based on spec‑defined behavior and product goals
- Does **not** redefine behavior through delivery pressure

Engineering feasibility concerns are surfaced early and resolved through collaboration, not silent compromise.

---

## 6. Required Skills

- Strong product judgment and strategic thinking
- Ability to balance customer value, business goals, and system constraints
- Clear decision‑making under uncertainty
- Excellent communication across technical and non‑technical stakeholders
- Comfort owning trade‑offs and saying “no”

---

## 7. Responsibilities

### 7.1 Product Vision & Strategy

- Define and communicate product vision and long‑term direction
- Ensure all major initiatives tie back to explicit product goals
- Prevent reactive or opportunistic scope creep

### 7.2 Prioritization & Trade‑Off Management

- Own prioritization across initiatives and teams
- Balance new capability, quality, and operational investment
- Make trade‑offs explicit and documented

### 7.3 Outcome Ownership

- Define what success means for the product
- Ensure metrics and evaluation criteria exist
- Hold the organization accountable for outcomes, not just output

### 7.4 Cross‑Role Alignment

- Ensure strong alignment between:
  - Product intent
  - Canonical specifications
  - Engineering delivery
- Resolve conflicts that span product, specs, and engineering

---

## 8. Explicit Non‑Responsibilities

The Product Owner does **not**:

- Own technical architecture or implementation details
- Author or edit canonical specifications directly
- Override documented behavior through informal direction
- Act as a proxy spec owner or engineering manager

This role leads through **clarity and prioritization**, not micromanagement.

---

## 9. Reporting & Interfaces

### Reports to
- Executive Leadership

### Direct Reports
- Head of Engineering
- Head of Specs Team

### Works closely with
- Design leadership
- Analytics and business stakeholders
- QA & Testing Owner
- Infrastructure & Operations Owner

---

## 10. Definition of Success

Someone doing this role well enables:

- A product with clear direction and coherence
- Specifications that reflect real, intentional decisions
- Engineering teams that build with confidence
- Fewer late‑stage reversals and surprises
- Measurable progress toward meaningful outcomes

The product evolves **intentionally**, not accidentally.

---

## 11. Guiding Principles

- Intent must be explicit before it is specified.
- What is built reflects what was decided.
- Trade‑offs are owned, not hidden.
- Outcomes matter more than activity.
