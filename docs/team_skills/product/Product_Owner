This role exists to ensure that the product:

- Solves the right problems  
- Delivers clear and intentional value  
- Evolves coherently over time  
- Aligns strategy, specifications, design, and engineering execution  

The Product Owner is the **single accountable owner of product intent and outcomes**.

---

## 3. Authority Model & Role Boundaries (Non-Negotiable)

### 3.1 Authority Relationships

- Product Owner owns **what the product is meant to achieve** and **why**  
- Head of Specs Team owns **canonical product truth** (formal definitions of behavior)  
- Head of UX & Design owns **experience expression** aligned to product intent  
- Head of Engineering owns **how the system is built and operated**  

All roles are peers in decision-making, with Product Owner as **tie-breaker on product direction and prioritization**.

---

## 5. Relationship to UX & Design

- Head of UX & Design reports to Product Owner  
- Product Owner ensures that experience decisions align with product goals  
- Product Owner ensures that UX artifacts are translated into canonical specifications  
- Design decisions do **not** override intent or formal specifications  

---

## 6. Relationship to Engineering Execution

- Prioritizes engineering work based on product value and risk  
- Makes scope and sequencing trade-offs explicit  
- Accepts or rejects outcomes based on spec-defined behavior, UX alignment, and product goals  
- Does **not** redefine behavior through delivery pressure  

---

## 7. Required Skills

- Strong product judgment and strategic thinking  
- Ability to balance customer value, business goals, and system constraints  
- Clear decision-making under uncertainty  
- Excellent communication across technical and non-technical stakeholders

  - Product intent  
  - UX & Design decisions  
  - Canonical specifications  
  - Engineering delivery  
  - Quality validation  

- Resolve conflicts that span product, design, specs, and engineering  

---

## 9. Explicit Non-Responsibilities

The Product Owner does **not**:

- Own technical architecture or implementation details  
- Author or edit canonical specifications directly  
- Override documented behavior through informal direction  
- Act as a proxy spec owner, UX/design owner, or engineering manager  

This role leads through **clarity and prioritization**, not micromanagement.
