## Priority Definitions

- **P0 — Critical**: Blocks correctness, trust, or release safety
- **P1 — High**: Enables core workflows or governance
- **P2 — Medium**: High leverage but not blocking
- **P3 — Low**: Nice-to-have or future scale

---

## 1. Platform & Validation Governance Backlog

These items ensure analytical correctness, validation integrity, and operational safety.
They are not user-facing, but they directly affect trust in outputs and release confidence.

---

### BLG-TECH-01 — Fix Sharpe variance method + Capital Efficiency currency basis
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Type:** Metrics Correctness / Validation Integrity
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-02-21

**Closed**
- `_calculate_sharpe()` updated to use sample variance (÷ n−1) for portfolio and trade-level Sharpe methods
- Capital efficiency updated to use `Mean(total_cost)` in GBP from `trade_history`
- `validation_data.py` expected values updated: `capital_efficiency` 0.17 → 0.22; `total_cost` fields added
- Validation: 13/13 pass confirmed at 2026-02-21T00:24:41Z
- Canonical Owner sign-off: 2026-02-21
- `metrics_definitions.md` v1.5.7 — Appendix E both items marked resolved
- `analytics_endpoints.md` v1.8.1 — resolved known limitations removed
- v1.6 quality gate: satisfied

BLG-TECH-02 — Implement validation severity model
Priority: P1 (High)
Type: Governance / Operational Control
Status: ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-02-21
Closed

severity field added to every validation result object (critical / high / medium / low)
by_severity aggregation added to summary — all four tiers always present
Severity mapping implemented in ValidationService per analytics_endpoints.md v1.8.1
Director of Quality sign-off: 2026-02-21T21:30:00Z
Phase Gate Document filed: docs/product/phase_gates/BLG-TECH-02-validation-severity-model-phase-gate.md

---

BLG-TECH-03 — Consolidate ValidationService into service layer
Priority: P1 (High)
Type: Architecture / Maintainability
Status: ✅ COMPLETE — 2026-02-21
Closed

All validation logic moved from routers/validation.py into services/validation_service.py
Router thinned to HTTP in/out only — delegates entirely to ValidationService.validate_all()
Stub replaced with full 13-metric + trade-Sharpe implementation
Delivered in same branch as BLG-TECH-02 per co-delivery constraint

### BLG-TECH-04 — CI/CD validation workflow (GitHub Actions)
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Delivery Quality / Automation
**Target release:** v1.7

**Problem**
- Validation is manual and not enforced at merge time.

**Scope**
- Add `.github/workflows/validate-analytics.yml`.
- Run `POST /validate/calculations` on:
  - Pull requests
  - Pushes to `main` and `develop`
- Block merge if any **critical-severity** validation fails.
- Post validation summary as PR comment.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Workflow reliably runs on all PRs.
- Merge is blocked only for critical severity failures.
- Clear PR feedback is visible.

**Dependencies**
- BLG-TECH-02 (severity model must exist).

**Owners**
- Engineering
- QA

---

### BLG-TECH-05 — Prometheus metrics endpoint
**Priority:** P3 (Low — v2.1 candidate)
**Type:** Observability

**Scope**
- Add `GET /metrics` Prometheus endpoint exposing:
  - Validation run count
  - Failure count by metric and severity
  - Validation duration
- Optional Grafana dashboard.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Metrics scrape successfully in Prometheus format.
- Counters and histograms are correct.

**Target**
- v2.1 or when system becomes multi-user.

---

## 5. Lifecycle Governance Notes

- This backlog is not canonical and must never override:
  - Strategy rules
  - Metrics definitions
  - API contracts
- Any shipped feature must be backed by:
  - Canonical specification
  - Updated validation where applicable
- Once implemented, backlog items are superseded by canonical documentation.
