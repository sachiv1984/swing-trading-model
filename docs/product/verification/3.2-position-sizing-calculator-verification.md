| B26 | Existing settings rows unaffected by migration | ✅ Pass | All pre-existing fields intact, default_risk_percent: 1.0 |

### Frontend — Widget idle and loading states

| # | Criterion | Result | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|
| F1 | Widget visible on form load without any user action | ✅ Pass | DEF-001 resolved prior to verification (see Defects section) |
| F2 | Risk % field pre-populated from settings.default_risk_percent | ✅ Pass | |
| F3 | Loading state shown during debounce | ✅ Pass | |
| F4 | No API call when Entry Price or Stop Price empty | ✅ Pass | |

### Frontend — Widget valid states and auto-fill

| # | Criterion | Result | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|
| F5 | Shares field empty → auto-fills with suggested_shares | ✅ Pass | Shares suggested to 4dp, confirmed correct per spec |
| F6 | Shares field already populated → not overwritten, "Use suggested shares" button appears | ✅ Pass | Button styling unconfirmable against spec (secondary/outline) — Low severity observation |
| F7 | Clicking "Use suggested shares" fills Shares and hides button | ✅ Pass | |
| F8 | Risk % change triggers recalculation | ✅ Pass | Existing shares remain stable during recalculation, confirmed correct per spec |

### Frontend — Widget insufficient cash state

| # | Criterion | Result | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|
| F9 | cash_sufficient: false → informational display, Shares not auto-filled, button not shown | ✅ Pass | Amber estimated cost styling unconfirmable — Low severity observation |
| F10 | max_affordable_shares value matches API response | ✅ Pass | Screen value 4.9841 matches TS-B08(A) response |

### Frontend — Widget invalid input states

| # | Criterion | Result | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|
| F11 | INVALID_STOP_DISTANCE → amber message "Stop price must be below entry price" | ✅ Pass | |
| F12 | INVALID_RISK_PERCENT → amber message "Risk % must be greater than zero" | ✅ Pass | |
| F13 | INVALID_ENTRY_PRICE → amber message shown | ❌ Fail | No error message displayed. See DEF-002 |
| F14 | INVALID_STOP_PRICE → amber message shown | ❌ Fail | No error message displayed. See DEF-003 |

### Frontend — Widget invalid system state

| # | Criterion | Result | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|
| F15 | NO_PORTFOLIO_VALUE_SNAPSHOT → muted grey message | ⏳ Deferred | Requires database access — deferred to re-verification pass |

### Frontend — Widget network failure and form submission

| # | Criterion | Result | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|
| F16 | Network failure → dashes shown, form submittable | ✅ Pass | Network set to Offline via DevTools. Widget showed `—`. Submit button disabled until Shares manually entered — correct form validation behaviour, not a widget block. Once Shares entered, Submit enabled. Form submittable confirmed. |
| F17 | Form submits regardless of widget state | ✅ Pass | Widget showing INVALID_STOP_DISTANCE amber message. Shares manually entered, form completed and submitted. Position created and visible on Positions page. Widget state did not block submission. |
| F18 | Post-submit: widget resets, Risk % retains last-used value | ❌ Fail | After submission app navigates to Positions page. On returning to Trade Entry, Risk % reset to settings default `1.00` rather than retaining session value `2.00`. Component unmount on navigation loses in-session override. See DEF-006. |

### Frontend — Settings page

| # | Criterion | Result | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|
| F19 | default_risk_percent field present in Strategy Parameters section | ✅ Pass | |
| F20 | Helper text exact match | ❌ Known deviation | Observed: "Pre-populates the position sizing calculator". Expected: "Pre-filled in the Position Sizing Calculator on trade entry. This is your default — you can override it per trade." Low severity — cosmetic only |
| F21 | Saving 0 rejected with error message | ❌ Fail | Value accepted in UI, no error message shown. Backend correctly rejects (HTTP 422) but frontend does not surface the error. See DEF-004 |
| F22 | Saving negative value rejected with error message | ❌ Fail | Same behaviour as F21. See DEF-004 |
| F23 | Valid value persists and pre-populates widget on next load | ✅ Pass | Saved 2.50, confirmed on Trade Entry load. Restored to 1.00 after test |

### Regression

| # | Area | Result | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| R1 | Trade Entry form submits without widget interaction | ✅ Pass | Position created successfully without using widget |
| R2 | Existing positions unaffected | ✅ Pass | All pre-existing positions unchanged after full test run |
| R3 | Existing settings unaffected by migration | ✅ Pass | All pre-3.2 fields retain stored values |

## Defects Raised

### DEF-001 — Widget produces no output (RESOLVED)
- **Severity:** High
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved prior to verification
- **Criterion:** F01
- **Root cause:** `PositionSizingWidget.js` imported `base44` and called `base44.api.post()` which does not exist on the `base44` object. API call silently failed, catch block fired, widget showed nothing.
- **Fix:** Updated import to `api` from `base44Client`. Added `api.portfolio.size()` method to `base44Client.js`. Updated response handling to reflect `doFetch` envelope unwrapping (`response.valid` not `response.data.valid`).
- **Re-verified:** F01–F04 all pass post-fix.

### DEF-002 — INVALID_ENTRY_PRICE message not rendered
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Status:** 🔴 Open — assigned to Head of Engineering
- **Criterion:** F13
- **Observed:** Entry Price set to 0, Stop Price 90.00 — widget shows no error message
- **Expected:** Amber message "Enter a valid entry price above zero"
- **Spec ref:** `position_form.md §Widget States — Invalid user input condition`
- **Likely cause:** `INVALID_ENTRY_PRICE` reason code not handled in widget's explicit message rendering block

### DEF-003 — INVALID_STOP_PRICE message not rendered
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Status:** 🔴 Open — assigned to Head of Engineering
- **Criterion:** F14
- **Observed:** Stop Price set to 0, Entry Price 100.00 — widget shows no error message
- **Expected:** Amber message "Enter a valid stop price above zero"
- **Spec ref:** `position_form.md §Widget States — Invalid user input condition`
- **Likely cause:** Same as DEF-002 — `INVALID_STOP_PRICE` not in explicit handler

### DEF-004 — Settings page silently swallows invalid save
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Status:** 🔴 Open — assigned to Head of Engineering
- **Criteria:** F21, F22
- **Observed:** Setting default_risk_percent to 0 or negative value — save button responds, no error message displayed. Value does not persist (reverts on refresh) confirming backend correctly rejects via HTTP 422 — but frontend does not surface the rejection to the user.
- **Expected:** Validation error displayed informing user the save was rejected
- **Spec ref:** `settings.md v1.1 §Strategy Parameters`
- **Note:** Backend constraint enforcement is correct (confirmed B22/B23). Frontend-only defect.

### DEF-005 — suggested_shares calculation not fully traceable
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Status:** 🔴 Open — assigned to Head of Engineering
- **Criterion:** B04
- **Observed:** `suggested_shares: 5.6003` returned for inputs `entry_price: 100, stop_price: 90.53, risk_percent: 1.00`. Manual calculation produces `5.6013`. Head of Engineering traced multiple code paths (Decimal quantisation, stamp duty adjustment, floating point precision) and was unable to reproduce the returned value from any consistent path.
- **Expected:** Calculation fully traceable per `strategy_rules.md §4.1` with every intermediate step reproducible
- **Action:** Head of Engineering to instrument `sizing_service.py` with debug logging, capture intermediate values for the above inputs, identify divergence point, fix or formally document the behaviour
- **Note:** 0.001 shares is not materially significant to the user but the calculation must be fully traceable for a financial tool. Escalated from OBS-002 after engineering review.

### DEF-006 — Risk % resets to settings default after navigation
- **Severity:** Low
- **Status:** 🔴 Open — assigned to Head of Engineering
- **Criterion:** F18
- **Observed:** Risk % set to `2.00` during session. After form submission, app navigates to Positions page. On returning to Trade Entry, Risk % shows `1.00` (settings default) — in-session value not retained.
- **Expected:** Risk % retains last-used value within the session per `position_form.md §Widget — post-submit behaviour`
- **Likely cause:** Widget component unmounts on navigation and remounts from settings default — no session persistence of Risk % override
- **Note:** Low severity — settings default of `1.00` is a reasonable fallback. User impact is minor (must re-enter preferred Risk % on each visit to Trade Entry). Would require session storage or lifted state to persist across navigation.

## Observations

**OBS-001 — HTTP 422 vs HTTP 400 for settings constraint violations**
B22–B24 returned HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Entity) rather than HTTP 400. This is standard FastAPI/Pydantic behaviour and is consistent with B16–B19. Minor spec/implementation drift — `settings_endpoints.md` documents HTTP 400 for validation failures. Recommend API Contracts owner updates spec to reflect 422 for Pydantic validation errors. Low priority.

**OBS-002 — B04 calculation discrepancy (ESCALATED TO DEF-005)**
`suggested_shares` returned 5.6003 for inputs entry_price: 100, stop_price: 90.53, risk_percent: 1.00. Manual calculation produces 5.6013. Head of Engineering reviewed `sizing_service.py` and could not reproduce the value through any consistent code path (Decimal quantisation, stamp duty adjustment, or floating point precision). Escalated to DEF-005. See Defects section.

**OBS-003 — "Use suggested shares" button styling unconfirmable**
F06: button present and functional. Styling (secondary/outline per spec) could not be confirmed visually against spec definition. Low priority — recommend Frontend Specifications & UX Documentation Owner clarifies colour values in spec.

**OBS-004 — Amber estimated cost styling unconfirmable**
F09: insufficient cash state correctly rendered. Amber styling on estimated cost could not be confirmed visually. Same recommendation as OBS-003.

**OBS-005 — Settings page flicker on keystroke**
Every keystroke in the default_risk_percent field causes page re-render. Likely cause: settings save triggering on change rather than on explicit save action, causing re-fetch and re-render cycle. Low severity UX issue — not a spec violation but poor experience for a daily-use field. Assigned to Head of Engineering to investigate.

## Deferred Scenarios

One scenario remains deferred due to environment constraint:

| # | Reason for deferral |
|---|---------------------|
| F15 | Requires database access (BEGIN/ROLLBACK) — environment constraint. To be executed in re-verification pass. |

F16, F17, F18 have been executed and results recorded in this update (v1.1).

---

## Phase 1 Gate Check

- [x] Verification report completed and filed
- [x] Every non-deferred acceptance criterion has a recorded result
- [x] No Critical or High severity defects open
- [x] Five open defects raised and assigned to engineering (DEF-002, DEF-003, DEF-004, DEF-005, DEF-006)
- [x] One known Low severity deviation logged (F20 helper text)
